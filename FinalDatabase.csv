1,RE: NERC Meeting Today,There was an all day meeting of the NERC/reliability legislation group today. I will provide a more detailed report but the group completed the process of reviewing the changes that some had suggested to shorten and streamline the NERC electric reliability organization legislation. Sarah and I asked a series of questions and made comments on our key issues and concerns. I want to give you a more complete report once I have gone back over the now final draft version. The timing being imposed by NERC is that they will circulate a clean version of the proposal tomorrow or Monday. They have asked for comments by next Thursday August 16th with an indication of whether each company/organization does or does not sign on to support it. They will then transmit the proposal and the endorsement letter to Congress and the Administration so they have it as Hill and Energy Dept. staff work on electricity drafting issues this month. I pointed out that EPSA is not due to meet internally with its members to discuss these issues until after the NERC deadline. That is not deterring NERC from moving forward with the above time frame.,"NERC; Meetings; Legislation; Electricity

5,CONFIDENTIAL - Residential in CA,In the meeting today no decision was made about what to do with Enron's 16000 residential customers. Each of the contracts gives a basic 30 day out right to Enron. That being said I think that we have a short window to push for DA before any public action impacts us in Sacramento. I realize that the ultimate action (which I think is inevitable) makes it harder for our advocacy on DA but real $ are flowing out of the company. EES will give us notice when a decision is reached.

7,Re: Privileged and Confidential communication to my attorneys,Felicia This is a merchant asset which we currently own 100% but plan to sell down in the coming months. It absolutely has separate HR functions from Enron -- they do not participate in Enron benefits and we are working hard to prevent any claims that we could be a joint employer with it. Thoughts? Michelle Enron North America Corp. From: Felecia Acevedo @ ENRON 11/02/2000 08:56 AM To: Michelle Cash/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Subject: Re: Privileged and Confidential communication to my attorneys Michelle who is GSP? Are they a legal entity? Are they on our payroll? If they are we filed EEO-1's for them. Below is the criteria to file an EEO-1 report: Standard Form 100 must be filed by - A. All private employers who are: (1) subject to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (as amended by the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972) with 100 or more employees EXCLUDING State and local governments primary and secondary school systems institutions of higher education Indian tribes and tax-exempt private membership clubs other than labor organizations OR (2) subject to Title VII who have fewer than 100 employees if the company is owned or affiliated with another company or there is centralized ownership control or management (such as central control of personnel policies and labor relations) so that the group legally constitutes a single enterprise and the entire enterprise employs a total of 100 or more employees. B. All federal contractors (private employers) who: (1) are not exempt as provided for by 41 CFR 60-1.5 (2) have 50 or more employees and (a) are prime contractors or first-tier subcontractors and have a contract subcontract or purchase order amounting to $50000 or more or (b) serve as a depository of Government funds in any amount or (c) is a financial institution which is an issuing and paying agent for U.S. Savings Bonds and Notes. All multi-establishment employers i.e. employers doing business at more than one establishment must file: (1) a report covering the principal or headquarters office (2) a separate report for each establishment employing 50 or more persons (3) a consolidated report that MUST include ALL employees by race sex and job category in establishments with 50 or more employees as well as establishments with fewer than 50 employees and (4) a list showing the name address total employment and major activity for each establishment employ-ing fewer than 50 persons must accompany the consolidated report. All forms for a multi-establishment company must be collected by the headquarters office for its establishments or by the parent corporation for its subsidiary holdings and submitted in one package. For the purposes of this report the term parent corporation refers to any corporation which owns all or the majority stock of another corporation so that the latter stands in the relation to it of a subsidiary. The OFCCP has always held that subsidiary companies that do not have direct govt contracts must comply with AAP regulations if the parent company or other subsidiary companies benefit from government contracts. Their line of thought is that the subsidiary without government contracts benefits indirectly from the contract as well. If GSP is completely free standing and they do not participate in Enron's benefits abide by our policies or procedures  participate in our bonus process that may partially or wholly be funded by Enron Corp.  etc. they may have some type of argement not to comply but I doubt it. If we own them over 51% I don't see a way they could not file EEO-1's and have an AAP. We do all the AAP's in Corporate so if this is a freestanding Business Unit I need to know. Thanks!

13,Re: Mtg w/Bob Gee,I think this is a great initiative but it is critically important that any announcement of the panel makes it crystal clear that the objective of the group is to come up with standards to facilitiate competition. We will do nothing but waste time if it becomes a negotiation over competition. the best and politically easiest time to make that objective clear is in the original announcement not after the group gets underway. Can we get in touch with DOE to make sure they pick this up?

It is looking positive that he may be positioned to make the announcement Monday. However DOE will likely need to revisit some folks on the current Blue Ribbon Reliability Panel in order to replace some of the utility transmission-only focused members with others who focus on business practices plus add additional people to represent the internet like APX Altra and HoustonStreet.Com. (these are Steve Kean's suggestions.) Too I have been cautioned about referring to the Blue Ribbon Reliability Panel as a model since their timeline was slow but rather suggest the TVA Blue Ribbon Panel model since they were able to issue a report after only four meetings. I have asked for this issue to be brought to Secretary Richardson's attention and advised this will be done this week. I have also discussed this with John Anderson of ELCON who is supportive.

Bob appeared comfortable with establishing a Blue Ribbon panel similar to the reliability panel to address this issue. In fact Bob suggested that the reliability panel which includes a balance of key stakeholders could be re-tasked with this issue. We recommended that the focus of any panel should be on the structure (governance segments executive committees) and scope of the organization (retail wholesale gas electric).

J= effords has never mattered much to Californians. Until now. The Verm= ont senator's widely anticipated decision to abandon his fellow Republican= s and put Democrats in control of the Senate could have big implications f= or California particularly on energy and environmental policy lawmakers = and lobbyists said Wednesday. The change which Jeffords is expected= to announce today could increase political pressure on the Bush adminis= tration to respond more aggressively to California's electricity crisis t= hese insiders said. And it might force the White House to compromise= on key elements of the national energy policy it unveiled last week. In f= act the administration's proposed budget cuts for programs to promote ren= ewable energy were said to be a factor in Jeffords' decision. At th= e very least Senate observers said Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) is l= ikely to get the floor vote she has sought on price controls for wholesale= electricity. That doesn't necessarily mean that the administration'= s critics will be able to have everything their way. Even if the Senate ap= proves electricity price caps for example the measure would face stiff o= pposition in the GOP-dominated House--and a likely veto if it made it to t= he president's desk. Still a Democratic majority in the Senate wou= ld give Feinstein and other party members a platform to turn up the politi= cal heat on the administration and congressional Republicans on energy pol= icy. It kicks up the dust groaned one energy industry lobbyist wh= o requested anonymity. Observed Sen. John F. Kerry (D-Mass.): If P= resident Bush's hard-edged conservative approach has in fact caused the ba= lance to shift towards Democrats in the Senate it will have profound impl= ications not just for California but for the environment and our nation's= energy policy. Environmentalists seemed almost giddy as they cont= emplated the possible impact of Jeffords' decision on the policies they ca= re about. All of a sudden they said it seems less likely that oil = exploration will take place in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge that r= ecreational snowmobiles will have free access to Yellowstone National Park=  or that the administration's desire to promote nuclear power will be emb= raced by Congress. On the other hand it seems more probable that C= ongress would approve a new plan for managing a vast swath of the Sierra N= evada to protect the region's oldest trees consider legislation to restri= ct emissions of carbon dioxide from power plants and protect California fr= om a resurgence of offshore oil drilling. It's stunning how broad t= he repercussions are particularly on the environment said Gregory Wetst= one of the Natural Resources Defense Council. We're trying not to count o= ur chickens before they hatch. But it will be easier for us in our battles= at least to keep from moving backwards. For instance Jeffords is= a chief advocate of a bill that would regulate carbon dioxide from power = plants. And if events play out as expected he'll become the new chairman = of the Senate committee with jurisdiction over the issue. Another i= ssue under his purview would be the two-decade dispute over a proposed rep= ository for the nation's spent nuclear fuel at Yucca Mountain in Nevada. = Yucca Mountain is a dead turkey declared Michael Francis of the W= ilderness Society. Environmentalists had been worried that a number= of pro-development provisions would be packed into appropriation bills. B= ut with Democratic senators in charge that would become less of a threat= they said. Every wacko idea Republicans have will get a higher lev= el of scrutiny Francis said. The biggest change would be the power= of Senate Democrats to decide which bills will be considered in committee= s and which ones will make it to the floor of the Senate for votes. = As part of a new Democratic majority Feinstein and fellow California De= mocrat Barbara Boxer are likely to gain leverage with the administration o= n a number of issues considered important to the state. That transl= ates into more federal assistance for California across the board predic= ted Steve Maviglio spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis. I think it mean= s more attention to our state for sure Boxer said. Right now the pres= ident doesn't seem to give a darn. They're all looking at California as a = Democratic state. They're not interested. Feinstein who has been = unable to arrange a meeting with Bush to discuss the energy crisis may ge= t better treatment if winning Democratic support becomes more important to= the administration. She has been regarded as a bridge-builder who worked = effectively with Republicans in the past. This has not been a warm = and friendly administration she complained Wednesday. They've got peopl= e who know all the answers and don't want to listen. The White Hou= se disputed that. In fact Bush agreed Wednesday to meet with Davis during= the president's first visit to California next week. Under a Democ= ratic majority Feinstein would be in line to chair two subcommittees: the= military construction panel of the Senate Appropriations Committee and t= he technology terrorism and government information subcommittee of the Se= nate Judiciary Committee. Boxer would be in line to chair the subco= mmittee on Superfund waste control and risk assessment and the Foreign R= elations subcommittee on international operations and terrorism. Mav= iglio predicted that the effects of Jeffords' expected party defection wou= ld be felt immediately. The chairmanship of the Senate Energy and N= atural Resources Committee would be taken away from Frank H. Murkowski (R-= Alaska) who has been openly hostile to California's plight and handed = to Jeff Bingaman (D-N.M.) who supports Davis' request for electricity pri= ce controls according to Maviglio. Democrats have assailed Bush's e= nergy plan for tilting heavily toward the supply side. With Democrats in c= harge of the Senate the administration would be more likely to compromise=  perhaps beefing up funding for Democrat-supported causes such as increas= ed energy assistance to low-income households and more aggressive promotio= n of conservation and renewable energy sources such as wind and solar powe= r.

17,Minutes from last Thurs CAISO Board Meeting (Sorry for the delay),CAISO BOG 10/25/01 Notes taken by G. Alan Comnes Meeting went from about 10:30 to 1 p.m. Written materials discussed at this meeting are available at www.caiso.com/bog. 1. Budget. Board approved budget which contains a significant increase in GMCs and for the first time applies GMC fees on the self provision of A/S. The motion to adopt was modified to say the Board would revisit budget if in response to Gov. Davis requests to par budgets the CAISO budget is cut. 2. Retirement plan Audit 3. Allocation of Above-MCP 487 charges. This mechanism will improve the allocation of OOM costs so that the per-MWh charges match up with actual OOM costs. Stated that penalty revenues used to lower OOM costs could come from imbalance penalties. Action. approved (?) to allow staff to make a tariff amendment on this change. 4. Winter Assessment. Presentation by staff Kahn took issue (i.e. did not even want staff report presented) that CAISO does an assessment without consulting the Power Authority CPUC and the CEC. Worried about conflicting with the other resource assessments out there and giving media ways to take shots at DWR buying practices. In the end the full presentation was not given but questions were asked about whether the assessment spells trouble or provides assurance. The answer: things are tight in some months but are expected to be ok given the level of conservative assumptions used in the analysis. Action: staff was tasked to compare this assessment with CEC's and others and come back in another month. 5. Generator maintenance program. Will use GADS data. This program is mandatory for PGA generator units. CAISO staffer represented that no other ISO has a prescriptive program like the one CAISO is proposing. Current schedule: brief FERC staff next week return to Board in November for approval make FERC filing implement in early '02. Benchmarks are based on each unit's historical performance i.e. dogs will be benchmarked against their past doggy behavior. There is no component to raise the bar on performance but a unit that falls relative to past performance would trigger further review. 6. MSC Selection Committee. MSC provides independent review of the CAISO markets for CAISO the state and FERC. Wolak is the only member left at the moment. Selection committee will be Sheffrin Wolak and Borenstein. Candidates will go to Exec. Director and the final candidates to the Board in February 2002 (!). Kahn questioned how the MSC can survive with only one member and take until February 02 to select a final members. Nonetheless the glacially paced schedule was adopted. 7. FERC RTO Seams Issues. Steve Greenleaf presented. Updated BOG on RTO week and said that the 4 RTO model took a step backward (off the table in the words of Chair Wood) in response to criticism from state PUCs on Thursday. (Is this an accurate recounting of Day 4?). ISO is engaged in interregional coordination. Mentioned CSIC group Mentions SSGWY's (?)sponsorship of a market monitoring workshop on November 16. 8. Update of CERS Settlement BEEP/AS Payment Procedure. Edison and PG&E are making progress but no agreement with CERS have been reached. SDG&E signed and the procedure was implemented at least in part with SDG&E. 9. Monthly reports: financial. 10. Monthly reports: DMA. Sheffrin. Mostly followed the briefing charts. Emphasized the following: CERS OOM purchases are generally down and are reasonably priced once purchases and sales are disaggregated. Said that suppliers are still bidding above costs. DMA files confidential reports that include info on bidding data weekly to FERC. Bids are not coming down. Intrazonal congestion is up due to new generation coming on line. That allows generators to play the dec game.,"CAISO; Minutes; Budget; Fees; Retirement plan; Allocation; Winter assessment; Generator maintenance; MSC selection; FERC RTO seams; CERS settlement; Monthly reports

The findings= =20 support the widespread belief that these suppliers reaped massive additiona= l=20 revenue by manipulating the market. ?????Spokesmen for the companies denied the accusation. ?????The study prepared for a filing with federal regulators today is=20 central to Cal-ISO's efforts to seek reimbursement for what it considers=20 excessive charges by electricity suppliers during the state's energy crisis= . ?????This might be the first time we told them the total impact and=20 magnitude [of the overcharging] said Anjali Sheffrin Cal-ISO's director = of=20 market analysis. We think the entire amount deserves consideration for=20 refunds. ?????Using confidential bidding data on tens of thousands of electricity=20 sales Cal-ISO found that five companies that together supply about 30% of= =20 the power delivered to customers of the state's investor-owned utilities=20 engaged in two types of behavior that tended to push up prices: ?????* They effectively withheld supplies by bidding at excessive prices= =20 even though they could have made some money selling more electricity. ?????* Less frequently they had power generation available but did not bid= =20 at all. ?????The study concluded that energy suppliers commonly offered their=20 electricity at twice their cost. For example Sheffrin said the average=20 markup in August was 100% during peak hours. ?????A spokeswoman at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission which=20 oversees wholesale electricity pricing across the country declined to=20 comment Wednesday saying This is part of an ongoing proceeding. ?????FERC member William L. Massey who has considered previous commission= =20 actions on refunds to be inadequate said it would be improper for him to= =20 comment on a report that has not yet been filed. But when told of the=20 $5.5-billion total Massey said: That doesn't shock me in any way. ?????Prices over the past 10 months in California have greatly exceeded th= e=20 federal standards of just and reasonable prices and I think they have=20 exceeded the standards by possibly billions of dollars he said. ?????Cal-ISO which oversees grid operations and an emergency energy market= =20 previously detailed $550 million in alleged overcharges for December and=20 January and asked FERC for refunds. But the commission has proposed refunds= =20 of only a tiny fraction of that amount. ?????The study covered five major in-state power suppliers--Reliant Energy= =20 Dynegy Williams/AES Duke Energy and Mirant formerly Southern Energy--plu= s=20 16 power importers all of which deliver power to customers of Pacific Gas = &=20 Electric Co. Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric Co. ?????All [21] overcharged but some excessively and some by moderate=20 amounts Sheffrin said. ?????Cal-ISO's public filing will quantify the alleged overcharging by each= =20 company but the companies will be identified only by a number. The code wi= ll=20 be provided to FERC Sheffrin said and Cal-ISO lawyers will determine how= =20 much information about the companies will be made public. ?????State U.S. Investigations ?????California electricity markets and the companies that buy and sell pow= er=20 in the state have been the subject of several investigations by state and= =20 federal authorities since wholesale electricity prices first skyrocketed in= =20 May. ?????Electricity suppliers have repeatedly denied manipulating the Californ= ia=20 market in any way whether through above-cost bidding in spot markets or=20 through physical withholding of electricity to drive up prices. ?????Reliant Energy is cooperating with FERC's requests for more data and i= s=20 confident the commission will conclude that prices charged by Reliant were= =20 justified said Joe Bob Perkins president of the Houston-based company. ?????Perkins also bitterly disputed charges that Reliant has shut down unit= s=20 so that it can earn bigger profits on the power sold by the remaining plant= s.=20 These charges have been leveled against all of the power-plant owners in th= e=20 state. ?????Reliant Vice President John Stout said Cal-ISO's calculations typicall= y=20 don't include such fixed costs as salaries taxes and the interest on bonds= =20 they sold to finance their power plants which they acquired under terms of= =20 the state's landmark 1996 deregulation law. ?????In addition he said many high-priced power days have resulted from= =20 buyers bidding against each other for scarce supplies rather than sellers= =20 charging excessive amounts--like a house price being driven far above the= =20 listing price in a hot real estate market. ?????Williams Energy Services a trading company that markets most of the= =20 power produced by plants owned by AES also says it will be exonerated by= =20 FERC once the commission examines documentation being submitted said Paula= =20 Hill-Collins spokeswoman for the Tulsa Okla. company. ?????FERC has the obligation to investigate when these accusations are=20 made Hill-Collins said. This is just a process of justification not=20 necessarily proof of guilt. ?????Williams/AES was recently ordered by FERC to prove that it did not tak= e=20 generating units out of service last year to drive up electricity prices o= r=20 refund $10.8 million to California utilities. ?????During the period studied suppliers sold electricity in the Californi= a=20 Power Exchange to Southern California Edison PG&E and San Diego Gas &=20 Electric Co. and in a backup market for last-minute electricity operated by= =20 Cal-ISO. But sky-high prices plunged Edison and PG&E deeply into debt and= =20 most suppliers stopped selling to them in January forcing the state=20 Department of Water Resources to step in as the primary electricity buyer f= or=20 the three big utilities' 27 million customers. ?????The Cal-ISO study first summarized at an energy conference last week = at=20 UC Berkeley but not otherwise publicized concluded that the companies=20 exercised so-called market power to pump up electricity prices. ?????Severin Borenstein director of the Energy Institute at Berkeley said= =20 Cal-ISO's study is consistent with his research examining pricing practices= =20 in 2000. ?????We found several billion dollars . . . in departures from competitive= =20 pricing he said. When the market was tight this summer they were able t= o=20 push up prices and they did. ?????The early warning signs of electricity price spikes the study found= =20 appeared in May after two years of relatively stable prices of $30 to $40 p= er=20 megawatt-hour under deregulation. Prices went up during the summer dipped = in=20 September and October with lower demand then took off in November and=20 December as weather turned cold and the price of natural gas which is used= =20 to generate much of the state's electricity reached record levels. ?????There were plant outages and demand and supply became close Sheffr= in=20 said. Whatever price they bid had to be taken and market power asserted= =20 itself. ?????Cal-ISO found that $3 billion of the alleged overcharges occurred=20 between May and November. ?????On Friday federal regulators ordered six wholesale power suppliers to= =20 refund $55 million to California if they cannot justify prices charged in= =20 February. The refund was limited to power sold that month in excess of $430= =20 per megawatt-hour during Stage 3 power alerts when supplies are so tight= =20 that rolling blackouts are threatened. (One megawatt-hour is enough=20 electricity to supply 750 typical homes for an hour.) ?????The previous week FERC ordered 13 suppliers to justify or refund $69= =20 million for power sold in January at prices above $273 per megawatt-hour. ?????Massey opposed the potential refunds as too low because they were=20 limited to hours in which a Stage 3 power emergency was in place and becaus= e=20 the benchmark price set for each month was too high--combining to exempt mo= re=20 than 70000 transactions from scrutiny. ?????We're still looking for our lost wallet under the lamppost which is= =20 Stage 3 alerts said Massey one of three commissioners on the five-member= =20 board (two seats are vacant). ?????Generators have been given the free and clear he said. ?????These tinkling little refunds they have come out with recently are=20 almost a joke said Cal-ISO board member Mike Florio senior attorney at t= he=20 Utility Reform Network. ?????Resisting Price Caps ?????Cal-ISO contends that the last 10 months have proved that generators c= an=20 no longer be allowed to receive electricity prices that are dictated by wha= t=20 the market will bear. ?????FERC granted market-based rate authority on each of these suppliers'= =20 own showing that they could not manipulate prices yet their actions have= =20 shown the contrary Sheffrin said.

The two utilities amassed=20 billions of dollars in debt when prices for wholesale power soared on the= =20 spot market. ?????Vikram Budhraja a consultant retained by Davis to negotiate deals wit= h=20 generators said the report represents a work in progress.

Davis's Plan To Power California --- State's Outlays for Electricity May Be Hard to Recover Without Rate Increases --- Betting on Long-Term Deals ------------------------ Breakthrough made in rescue of PG&E State ready to pay $7 billion for lines By Steve Geissinger SACRAMENTO BUREAU SACRAMENTO -- Signaling a breakthrough in secret energy crisis talks the Davis administration disclosed Tuesday it may announce the framework of a pact to rescue the teetering Pacific Gas and Electric Co. next week. Things are going very well said Steve Maviglio a spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis. The state appears to be poised to pay at least $7 billion -- and possibly billions more -- for PG&E's high-voltage transmission lines as part of a deal to financially renovate the north-state utility according to sources familiar with the negotiations. But consumer advocates insisted that even the $7 billion price is too much to pay. And experts warned that a deal with PG&E will be more complex than with other utilities. PG&E representatives declined comment in keeping with their policy on the talks even though the Davis administration said an announcement could come as early as next week or the following week. The new timetable for an announcement was substantially sooner than in Davis' original forecast. Until late last week PG&E was still resisting the sale of its power grid despite the fact that Davis had announced the framework of an agreement with Southern California Edison. Davis expects to soon announce a similar deal with the San Diego Gas and Electric Co. However any such deal still would need federal approval. The investor-owned utilities trapped between high wholesale costs and lower regulated retail rates amassed nearly $13 billion in debts and were unable to buy electricity this winter. With the onset of rolling blackouts the state began brokering billions of dollars in emergency short- and long-term power purchases. Davis' strategy to ease the energy price and supply crisis includes bolstering both conservation and generation while fiscally refurbishing the nearly bankrupt utilities. As part of the rescue deal the utilities would have to drop legal actions seeking dramatically higher electricity bills environmentally shield wildlands they own sell power from their generators to Californians for the next decade and secure help with their debts from their parent companies. Together with the cash infusion from the sale of their power 26000-mile power grids the utilities would be allowed to sell bonds to raise funds and use customer money to pay them off. The state would upgrade the high-voltage lines and lease them back to the utilities for operation. In a reflection of the negotiations with the three utilities a Davis administration official said the deal with PG&E is proving to be more complex than with the other firms. Though PG&E finally agreed late last week to sell its transmission grid the utility apparently wants more than the $7 billion that Davis has offered according to sources. The figure is more than twice the book amount or the value placed on the system for purposes of accounting. And that's the markup that lured Edison into an agreement to sell its smaller portion of the transmission grid for $2.8 billion. But PG&E which fears an erosion of its economic base may be asking as much as $10 billion. Due to complexities in the state's 1996 deregulation of the industry PG&E is more likely to lose revenue than Edison as a result of selling its transmission lines according to experts. Big customers might be able to bypass the utility's remaining local distribution lines thereby eroding its customer base. Therefore the utility may view bankruptcy and sale of its transmission lines to the highest bidder as a potentially attractive alternative to selling its share of the grid to the state at too low a price. ---- El Paso Energy closes six valley power plants Filed: 03/07/2001 By CHIP POWER Californian staff writer e-mail: ppower@bakersfield.com El Paso Energy citing non-payment from Pacific Gas & Electric Co. said it has shut down six cogeneration plants this week. The smaller plants produced about 175 megawatts of electricity and are located primarily in the San Joaquin Valley said company spokesman Mel Scott. A megawatt can supply power to 1000 homes. At least 10 plants have closed in the past two weeks as a result of non-payment according to the state Independent System Operator which manages most of the state's electrical distribution. The El Paso Energy plants are operated with various partners and had not been compensated for December January and February deliveries said Scott. He said he did not know the total amount due but said the plants would be closed until PG&E's credit worthiness is improved. A cogeneration plant common in oil fields simultaneously produces heat energy and electrical or mechanical power from the same fuel in the same facility. Typically it produces electricity and steam which can be deployed to enhance oil recovery. Kern County is the state's leading oil-producing county. El Paso owns or has interests in more than 40000 miles of interstate and intrastate pipeline connecting the nation's principal natural gas supply regions to the five largest consuming regions in the United States namely the Gulf Coast California the Northeast the Midwest and the Southeast. El Paso closed up 99 cents on Tuesday or 1.4 percent at $71.49. The Houston-based company's stock price has ranged between $36.31 and $75.30 in the last 52 weeks. ---- Still undecided: Who'll pay DWR for electricity By Karen Gaudette ASSOCIATED PRESS SAN FRANCISCO -- The price tag is $3.2 billion and counting for electricity bought by the state Department of Water Resources for the customers of two nearly bankrupt utilities. Pacific Gas and Electric Co. Southern California Edison and the state disagree over how the DWR eventually will be reimbursed for its purchases on the expensive last-minute power market. So do the state power regulators who have the final call over who gets the money when. Under a recent law the DWR went into the electricity-buying business to help keep the two utilities from sinking further into their $13 billion debt. The state plans to retrieve the money by selling $10 billion in revenue bonds. The utilities continue to collect ratepayer dollars on that electricity which the bill's author Assemblyman Fred Keeley D-Boulder Creek says is meant to help them begin paying down their debt. In a recent letter however DWR officials requested that the state Public Utilities Commission order that a portion of that money be diverted to the state. But after the utilities subtract the costs of generating electricity payments to environmentally friendly power plants and other expenses there is no money left from ratepayer dollars to give to the DWR without sinking further into debt PG&E spokesman Ron Low said Tuesday. If it passed along money to the DWR our undercollection would grow by about $2.4 billion by the end of the year Low said. The commission unable to agree on the best course of action left the issue untouched at its last meeting but expects to revisit the issue when it meets this morning. Commissioner Richard Bilas is proposing an alternate plan that would have the DWR set its own revenue requirements that would be passed on to ratepayers. The PUC also is expected to respond to complaints from laid-off workers and customers that layoffs by utilities to cut costs have been hurting service. Commissioner Carl Wood warned at the last meeting that failure to provide safe and reliable service could mean fines for the utilities. Representatives from electrical workers unions the PUC and the utilities were to discuss the issue Tuesday afternoon. I don't think we believe that utilities can find a way out of their problems by laying off workers said Mindy Spatt a spokeswoman with the Utility Reform Network. We think consumers deserve safe and reliable service and we think they deserve it at a reasonable price. ---- State Taxpayers In Dark on Details Of Energy Deal David Lazarus Chronicle Staff Writer Wednesday March 7 2001 2001 San Francisco Chronicle Few people would purchase a car simply because the dealer said ''Trust me it's a great deal.'' Yet Gov. Gray Davis essentially is telling Californians just that about dozens of long-term power contracts. Because of confidentiality agreements with power companies the governor has revealed only scant details about the state's multibillion-dollar contracts for electricity over the next 10 years. Gov. Davis has our money and we can't see how he's spending it said Doug Heller a spokesman for the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in Santa Monica. We've been locked out of the room. Neither Davis nor power companies would divulge specific details about the price duration or scope of individual contracts. Each cited secrecy clauses that the governor's office said had been desired by both sides. What consumers do know is this: -- California has signed 40 contracts and tentative accords valued at about $40 billion to secure enough power to light 9 million homes over the next decade. -- The average purchase price of each deal is $69 per megawatt hour -- well above the $30 to $40 charged by power generators before California's energy market went haywire last summer. -- If as is widely expected wholesale power prices fall in years ahead the state nevertheless will be locked into paying above-market rates for electricity. But it is not known which generator agreed to part with the most power at the cheapest level or the full range of the prices in concocting the $69 average. Moreover it is unclear how shrewdly the state negotiated with taxpayer money in securing power on behalf of cash-strapped utilities. These agreements are the bedrock of our long-term energy policy Davis said Monday in announcing the deals. The governor's office defended the murky nature of the contracts yesterday. It's a business transaction in which private corporate information is included said Steve Maviglio a spokesman for Davis. That's the kind of information that never gets revealed. While additional elements of the contracts will be publicized in coming months he said the contracts themselves will remain a secret. You'll never see all the details Maviglio said. This did not sit well with many observers. It's a breach of public trust said Daniel Bacon a San Francisco attorney specializing in business law. A public servant spending public money shouldn't be able to keep the spending secret. But Gary Ackerman executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum an energy-industry association in Menlo Park called confidentiality agreements a necessary evil in transactions like this. He explained that no power company would agree to a long-term contract if rival firms could learn the terms of the accord. The company would be losing too much of its competitive edge in the marketplace Ackerman said. At the same time he noted that secrecy allowed the buyer -- in this case California taxpayers -- to secure more favorable terms with individual sellers. A high price with one generator would not necessarily be sought by all power providers. Still the fact that public funds are being used makes confidentiality in this case a different matter than say Cisco Systems' quietly negotiating to take over yet another tech rival. The public is in a very awkward position said Michael Shames executive director of the Utility Consumers' Action Network in San Diego. It has to rely on the good word and expertise of the governor and he has yet to demonstrate that he has expertise or good word in this field. Shames likened consumers to passengers in a plane being flown by a pilot without a license to fly. But what choice do we have? he asked. I don't see many other options available right now. There's the rub. No matter how bad a deal California may have cut to help meet its energy demands the alternative -- blackouts disruptions economic catastrophe -- is far far worse. On the other hand it already appears that the new contracts will not shield Californians from the threat of daily outages this summer when demand surges. Davis said only about 60 percent of the state's summertime electricity needs so far had been met. Part of the reason is that many power companies already have contracted for their output this year. Duke Energy said this was why it would not begin its nine-year contract with California until 2002 while Williams Cos. said it would only gradually increase the amount of available wattage in its 10-year contract. Both companies meanwhile will continue to profit this summer by selling into the volatile spot market where wholesale power went for as much as $1 500 per megawatt hour last year. You can't sell all your power into long-term contracts said Paula Hall- Collins a Williams spokeswoman. You save some for the spot market. Consumer groups worry that consumers will be hammered again this summer with sky-high power prices and then get nailed down the road by contracts for above-market rates. If we could look at the terms of the deals we'd see that California is being gouged for 10 years said Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights. But the governor doesn't want us to see that. Ackerman of the Western Power Trading Forum said the state had gotten the best rates it could under current market conditions. California went for long-term contracts when everyone else moved in as well he said. Californians are paying a price for not acting sooner. ---- Lawmakers pitch fixes for region's energy woes By David Whitney Bee Washington Bureau (Published March 7 2001) WASHINGTON -- California members of Congress pleaded for everything from wholesale price caps to extending daylight-saving time an extra hour to help the region cope this summer with its persistent electricity shortage but none of the ideas seemed to catch fire at a House hearing Tuesday. People will die in California because of this crisis Rep. Brad Sherman a Los Angeles-area Republican warned the House Energy and Commerce Committee. Sherman testified that his idea for saving lives is to extend daylight-saving time by an extra hour so that there would be more daylight at the end of the day when power consumption surges. One of the peak demand periods for electricity occurs between 5 p.m. and 8 p.m. when the sun sets and people come home from work Sherman testified. If people come home and it is light out there is less of an inclination to turn a light on. Sherman said the state Legislature has called for congressional approval for states to be given authority to extend daylight-saving time and he cited analyses by the California Energy Commission and other agencies suggesting that it could cut power consumption by 1 percent to 2 percent. Sherman who was one of about a dozen California lawmakers presenting their views on the energy squeeze drew no questions from committee leaders about what his legislation might do to everything from airline schedules to television programming if West Coast states didn't agree on the same time standard. Most of the committee's questioning was on the more popular idea proposed by several California and Western lawmakers primarily Democrats to require the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to impose caps on wholesale electricity prices that have gone wild because of a regional power shortage. Rep. Bob Filner D-San Diego charged that the price spiral has little to do with power shortages but a lot to do with a small cartel of generators bilking ratepayers. Rep. Jay Inslee D-Wash. said he brought up the idea of regional price caps with President Bush who was initially skeptical. But Inslee said that Bush warmed to the idea after being told that protections could be built into the caps so as not to discourage construction of new power plants. Upon hearing that Inslee said Bush invited him to meet with the president's Cabinet-level task force led by Vice President Dick Cheney on a national energy strategy. But Inslee said he can't get the group to meet with him. It's very disappointing Inslee said. Tuesday's hearing was part of a series the panel is holding on the California crisis so far without any emerging consensus on what if anything Congress should do. ---- Power plan called wrong Wall Street analysts say the governor's approach to the problem avoids the issue that caused the imbalance. March 7 2001 By DON THOMPSON The Associated Press SACRAMENTO California's scramble to insulate consumers from the soaring price of electricity may add to the state's power problems this summer Wall Street analysts said Tuesday. Gov. Gray Davis' emphasis on buying utilities' transmission lines and negotiating long-term power contracts to help ease their debts skirts the deep imbalance between wholesale and market rates that led to the state's power problems in the first place they said. In the long run it doesn't solve anything said Michael Worms an industry analyst for Gerard Klauer Mattison & Co. In the long run you need to send the right price signals to consumers which will create its own conservation signals. Unfortunately customers were shielded from that in California. Davis said Monday that the state's first contracts to buy electricity for two financially struggling utilities will provide only about two-thirds of the power needed on a typical summer day forcing Californians to cut power use at least 10 percent to avoid blackouts. Since early January the state has been buying one- third of the power Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric Co. customers need. The two utilities denied credit by suppliers say they have lost nearly $14 billion due to soaring wholesale electricity prices that the state's industry-deregulation law says they cannot pass on to consumers. The keepers of the state power grid had enough electricity Tuesday to avoid declaring an electricity alert but have faced an almost-daily scramble for weeks due to a tight supply and high wholesale prices. Several wholesale and retail rate proposals are circulating. Among them: Free-market advocates such as Worms want an immediate end to the deregulation-imposed retail rate freeze on Edison and PG&E that will expire next year. Davis wants a Western price cap of $100 per megawatt hour on power generators he says have been prof iteering from California's short energy supply. The Bush administration and Federal Energy Regulatory Commission are cool to that idea. In December FERC imposed a soft cap of $150 per megawatt hour on wholesale rates in the state and required suppliers to justify any higher prices they charge. Consumer groups such as The Utility Reform Network or TURN want regulated rates for residential and small-business customers but free-market rates for large industrial customers which sought deregulation in the first place. TURN also advocates a tiered rate structure with higher rates for consumers who use more than a reasonable amount of electricity each month. Assembly Republicans say electricity and natural-gas prices will fall naturally if the state increases supply mainly by making it easier to build plants and pipelines. Right now you're sort of sitting partially with regulation and part with the free market said Paul Fremont an analyst with Jefferies & Co. Both these systems work. It's sort of that in-between system that you have in Califor nia that doesn't appear to be working. The system discourages generators from building new power plants because they aren't guaranteed a profit and it doesn't do enough to discourage power use by consumers because the price they pay doesn't reflect the true cost of power Fremont said. I don't think people here have much faith in the market and why should they? countered TURN's Mindy Spatt. I think there are probably better ways of encouraging consumers to conserve than by gouging them. Davis insists the crisis can be resolved without raising rates for Edison and PG&E customers beyond the existing rate structure. In January state regulators imposed temporary rate hikes of 7 to 15 percent on Edison and PG&E customers. The Legislature and Davis extended the increases for up to a decade to help pay back the estimated $10 billion in power buying the state expects to do for Edison and PG&E over the next several years and finance its purchase of the power lines owned by the two companies and San Diego Gas & Electric. Rates were already scheduled to increase next year for Edison and PG&E customers. Under the 1996 deregulation law the pair's ratepayers saw a 10 percent rate reduction but only until early 2002. That rate cut will likely expire as planned Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio has said. Davis wants those rates to cover not only the traditional cost of generating transporting and distributing power but the added cost of paying off the two utilities' massive debt and buying their transmission lines said Assemblyman Fred Keeley D-Boulder Creek the Assembly's chief power negotiator. Yet Davis has indirectly addressed the rate imbalance by signing legislation that will let regulators raise consumer rates if necessary Keeley said. The governor and lawmakers are in effect spreading out rate increases over a decade by using long-term revenue bonds to buy power for the nearly bankrupt utilities said Severin Borenstein director of the University of California Energy Institute. At some point we have to deal with the reality that all of the power that we buy has to be paid for by somebody - it's either going to come from taxpayers or it's going to come from ratepayers Bor enstein said. Raising rates now would get us a lot of conservation. Davis also wants financial incentives for conservation and power-plant construction in time to make a difference this summer. Our mouths were agape at the rapid timetable Keeley said. Legislators are rushing to pass those incentives by month's end he said allowing three months for consumers and suppliers to act before the heat of summer. Among bills considered Tuesday the Senate Energy Committee approved legislation to accelerate the siting of power plants. It also was considering a proposal to restructure rates for generators that use renewable energy to provide about 30 percent of the state's electricity. ---- Bill to Cut Some Power Prices Stalls Energy: Democrats balk at varying payment levels for alternative generators. By DAN MORAIN JULIE TAMAKI Times Staff Writers SACRAMENTO--Legislation aimed at cutting prices for more than a fourth of the power consumed in California stalled Tuesday as Democrats questioned why a few alternative energy generators--some of them campaign donors--stood to receive higher payments than others. Lawmakers working to unravel California's energy mess have been negotiating for weeks in an effort to cut the price paid to more than 600 generators of alternative power by more than half to below 8 cents a kilowatt-hour. Those alternative generators' contracts with utilities have shot up in recent months because of a rise in the price of natural gas. The cash-strapped corporations have suspended or made partial payments to the generators over the last few months causing many to shut down or reduce their outputs. But even as the lawmakers reached agreement that pushed the average price to near the 8-cent level per kilowatt-hour some generators would have received higher prices under the bill by state Sen. Jim Battin (R-La Quinta). Some of the generators that stood to benefit had donated to Battin's campaigns. One--Windtec Inc.--gave Battin a $20000 campaign donation in 1999. Others contributed from $3000 and $5000 last year. Battin acknowledged that he has received campaign contributions from some wind power generators but said there is no connection between the donations and the bill's provisions. It is illegal it is unethical and it's not how I do business he said. Battin noted that 25% of the state's alternative energy producers are in his district. As Democrats on the Senate Energy Committee blocked the bill Battin warned that some alternative energy producers might react to the delay by trying to force Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric into bankruptcy. We will be the cause of bankruptcy Battin said. That prompted Energy Committee Chairwoman Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey) to retort: I'm really tired of being threatened with bankruptcy. Alternative energy producers including those that use wind solar power biomass and other means produce 27% of the energy used in California. They sell the electricity to the utilities which in turn transmit it to retail consumers. But with the utilities facing multibillion-dollar debts the alternative energy producers under contract with Edison have not been paid since November. Scores of alternative energy producers supported the measure. Edison International and the San Francisco-based consumer group the Utility Reform Network opposed it. Michael Florio of the Utility Reform group said the deal could result in higher consumer prices an Edison representative said the same thing. Battin and Assemblyman Fred Keeley (D-Boulder Creek) worked out an arrangement with many of the generators. Keeley took the lead in the early negotiations and then turned to Battin to introduce the legislation SB 47X. Rather convoluted language would have allowed higher payments to a select few generators that produce electricity from wind and biomass. Most of California's wind suppliers for instance would have received about 6 cents per kilowatt-hour. But a handful of them about half a dozen wind farms--mostly in the Palm Springs area represented by Battin--would have received 7.8 cents. Battin contends that other wind producers receive additional payments that boost them to the same level as Windtec and others that would get the higher payments. They get the same deal Battin said of the handful of generators that would benefit from the provisions he added to the bill. In California's overall energy market the amount of money that would have flowed to the favored generators is minor. But the added prices that would have been paid to the generators would have translated to at least $19 million in the next five years to be absorbed by Southern California Edison customers according to one analysis. Also Tuesday more details were disclosed about another leg of the state's effort to escape from the energy crunch--the deals with large power generators to supply electricity to California for as long as 10 years. Those arrangements were announced by Gov. Gray Davis Monday as the bedrock of California's energy policy. But some consumer advocates warned that the deals could lock the state into excessively high-priced contracts. S. David Freeman the general manager of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and Davis' negotiator said that the state guarded against that by varying the time spans of its deals. About 6000 megawatts are expected to be available this summer about one-third of the energy needed by the state Freeman said. The amount of power under contract swells until more than 9000 megawatts are contracted in 2004 half of the needed amount before dipping to 8000 megawatts in 2010. What we're doing here is what everybody said had to be done Freeman said. We deliberately bought 50% so we'd have a good mix between long-term contracts which may turn out to be somewhat higher or somewhat lower than the spot market and purchases on the spot market. ---- PG&E could face mutiny on outages: SMUD others may balk if utility orders summer blackouts By Carrie Peyton Bee Staff Writer (Published March 7 2001) Sacramento's electric utility wants out of a deal that imposes rolling blackouts locally on PG&E's command. So do a lot of other utilities. They've been writing letters lobbying lawmakers and launching informal talks with Pacific Gas and Electric Co. to get off the hook before summer. Who dodges the blackout bullet is going to play out as a political hot button around the state said George Fraser head of the Northern California Power Agency a coalition of municipal utilities. In Sacramento the next volley is expected soon with the Sacramento Municipal Utility District reportedly poised to notify PG&E that it will no longer black out homes and businesses on the larger utility's command. We are absolutely trying to fight off the requirement for rolling blackouts for the Sacramento area said Linda Davis one of seven elected members of the SMUD board of directors. Saying they don't want to be dragged down by somebody else's problems two Southern California utilities have written grid operators asking to be exempted from any blackouts caused by PG&E's or Southern California Edison's financial woes. But in PG&E's view California is in an energy crisis (and) ... we're all in this together said spokesman John Nelson. The maneuvering comes amid bleak forecasts for power supplies this summer. Although Gov. Gray Davis has said conservation new power plants and moderate weather could avert blackouts officials at the Independent System Operator which runs much of California's grid expect frequent rotating outages. One consulting firm Cambridge Energy Research Associates predicts 20 hours of rolling blackouts during July and August and about 200 hours of especially intense calls for voluntary cutbacks. Before blackouts hit the jockeying over just whose lights air conditioners and assembly lines will be shut down is growing. The outcome could affect millions of people statewide. The state Public Utilities Commission is probing rolling blackout programs run by the for-profit utilities it regulates including PG&E and Edison. A PUC analysis has suggested that PG&E's program which currently exempts about 40 percent of its customers should spread the burden more broadly. For example it said 1.9 million homes and businesses are spared just because they share a circuit with a customer deemed essential. But not-for-profit utilities such as SMUD which answer to their own elected boards or city councils have other worries. Many have already lined up their power supplies for summer. Some have raised rates or are considering raising rates. Some have taken extra conservation steps. They think those preparations ought to give them leverage to ease blackout clauses in their contracts with PG&E. SMUD general manager Jan Schori is going to use every avenue ... any avenue to put pressure on including lobbying the ISO the governor and others said utility director Davis. The Northern California Power Agency a joint-powers authority that owns and operates power plants for municipal utilities has begun informal negotiations with PG&E to change blackout rules according to Fraser its top executive. It is preparing to write PG&E asking that its members be exempted from outages altogether. Failing that it wants them to face fewer outages or to be compensated for cutting off power he said. At SMUD the utility board has met in closed session to discuss exactly what it is required to do during electric emergencies under terms of the interconnection contract that links SMUD's lines to PG&E's. The contracts are being inspected with a fine-tooth comb said SMUD director Howard Posner. Schori declined to comment on any specifics. Sources indicated that the main option being considered is notifying PG&E that because of changed circumstances SMUD believes it no longer is required to routinely comply with outage requests. Other options being explored include re-negotiating existing agreements with PG&E. Posner said that ever since two days of rolling blackouts in January constituents have been asking him  'Why are we participating when we're not the problem?' And I don't have a good answer to that. Several directors said SMUD has already spent a lot of money -- and is considering 16 percent rate increases -- to ensure that it has enough electricity under contract to meet its customers' summer demands. They believe PG&E should do the same. We're almost like a David against Goliath here said board vice president Genevieve Shiroma. The huge investor-owned utilities next door have severe problems that they need to get under control. In addition SMUD plans to argue that because it can cut usage through its Peak Corps program which remotely turns off air conditioners at volunteer households it has already done its part without rotating outages director Davis said. PG&E believes the interconnection agreements that govern smaller utilities' ties to its transmission lines have benefits and burdens to both sides said Nelson. It wouldn't be fair or good policy for just one provision to be altered without taking a look at how that affects the entire contract he said. Interconnection contracts generally have clauses that require utilities to help each other out to avert greater emergencies. Sometimes reducing demand -- called load shedding -- can be the only way to stabilize the electric grid in the seconds after a major power plant or transmission line fails. It's been around in the electrical fabric forever said Jim Pope head of Silicon Valley Power Santa Clara's city-run utility. In addition to legal requirements you have a moral obligation so you don't bring the system to collapse. Like other city-run utilities Silicon Valley Power has a contract with PG&E that requires it to shed load during an electric emergency. But its contract allows it to work with big users to reduce their demand so no one has to be completely shut off. Such agreements formed long before deregulation when PG&E ran the north state's grid now are complicated by the 1997 creation of the state Independent System Operator. The ISO today runs pieces of the grid owned by PG&E Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric Co. If it believes power use is about to surge past supply potentially triggering a grid collapse across the western United States the ISO notifies the three utilities that they have to shed a certain number of megawatts. The big utilities meet that requirement two ways. They cut circuits to some of their own customers and they tell smaller connected utilities to cut a proportionate share. In Northern California about 80 percent of the outages are borne by PG&E customers and the rest by customers of SMUD and other municipal utilities and irrigation districts. In one sense we are all in this together. If SMUD were in danger of going down we would hope others would help us out said SMUD's Posner. But that's if we're in danger from circumstances beyond our control not from mismanagement or lack of financial wherewithal. It is unclear what penalties if any a utility would face for violating an interconnection agreement. In the long run the issue would be fought either in the courts or before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission grid officials said. As a practical matter in the seconds when the risk to the grid is greatest if one utility refused to shed load the ISO would probably solve to problem by calling on PG&E Edison or others who are willing to make deeper cutbacks they said. ---- PUC to Decide Fate Of Utility Workers PG&E Edison want to trim costs by laying off thousands cutting service Bernadette Tansey Chronicle Staff Writer Wednesday March 7 2001 2001 San Francisco Chronicle State regulators are set to decide today whether debt-ridden Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern California Edison can conserve cash by laying off thousands of workers and letting service standards slip. Union officials who protested the layoffs before the California Public Utilities Commission warn that if the cuts go through neighborhoods hit by power outages could stay dark for hours and more customers could face busy signals when they call about their bills. An administrative law judge agreed advising the commission in February to order the utilities to restore 725 positions already cut and block the elimination of an additional 2125 jobs. Judge John Wong said PG&E and Edison have acknowledged the layoffs will not substantially improve their shaky financial condition which arose from skyrocketing wholesale electricity costs the utilities could not pass on to consumers under a rate cap. The savings would barely make a dent Wong said in his draft decision. The two companies together claim that their debt from power purchases amounts to more than $13 billion. PG&E says it has saved $18 million from the first wave of 325 layoffs. Wong's recommendation is already running into resistance on the PUC. Commissioner Richard Bilas said the five-member panel should not be micromanaging the utilities in a time of crisis. Bilas has proposed an alternate ruling that would allow the utilities to make the cuts but provide for PUC monitoring of service in case the commission wants to step in later. We're in a situation where the utilities are not collecting the revenues they need to operate and yet we may be guilty of not letting them cut expenses where they can cut expenses Bilas said. PG&E spokesman Jon Tremayne said savings from the layoffs are helping to keep electricity running and gas flowing. It keeps cash in our accounts so we can keep doing day-to-day business Tremayne said. In addition to the 325 positions dropped so far PG&E is proposing to cut an additional 675 during the next three to six months. The cuts affect temporary and contract workers who read meters handle new service hookups and replace equipment. PG&E has no plans to eliminate permanent positions. The company is struggling to keep up with a higher workload at its call center as customers deluge the lines with inquiries about their rising bills and the effects of deregulation. Calls to PG&E ballooned from 1.3 million in January 2000 to 2.3 million in January 2001. Bilas advocates granting PG&E's request to temporarily relax standards requiring the utility to respond swiftly to customer calls and to read customers' meters once a month. PG&E wants to read meters bimonthly and send bills based on the estimated use between readings. Discrepancies could be corrected later. Wong called those measures unacceptable. He said customers need to know immediately if their efforts to conserve power are working. Wong also said the utilities' own experts have said the workforce reductions will lengthen the time required to restore power after nonemergency equipment failure. Eric Wolfe communications director for the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 1245 said some customers have already been left without power overnight because PG&E is trying to avoid the use of overtime on nonemergency power outages. It hurts a lineman to walk away from the job leaving a customer without power Wolfe said. Tremayne said PG&E is trying to minimize overtime costs but denied the company has allowed customers to go without power out of financial concerns. He said crews were pulled out when darkness and falling trees made the work too dangerous. ---- Power prices could soar during the summer Posted at 10:35 p.m. PST Tuesday March 6 2001 BY STEVE JOHNSON Mercury News Unless Gov. Gray Davis arranges significantly more long-term electricity contracts or persuades people to turn off a lot more lights California's unpredictable spot market for power could wreak havoc this summer. Even with the 40 long-term deals announced by Davis on Monday experts interviewed Tuesday said up to 43 percent of the state's daily needs may have to come from this highly volatile market in which power is bought within a day of need. That could could prove hugely expensive because some spot market energy has cost five to six times what it would under the long-term contracts. It's widely expected that consumers ultimately would have to pay that tab which could amount to billions of dollars. And because that power won't be locked up in contracts there is no guarantee it will be available when it's needed which could lead to blackouts according to a recent report to the California Independent System Operator which oversees three-fourths of the state's power grid. ``The situation in California could reach catastrophic proportions'' the report concluded adding that unless things change dramatically ``it is a virtual certainty that peak demand will go unmet during many hot summer days.'' Steven Maviglio Davis' press secretary conceded Tuesday that the spot market could be troublesome. ``It's a major concern'' he said which is why the state is trying to line up more power contracts speed up power plant construction and promote conservation. During the normally hot month of August peak daily demand for power in the Independent System Operator's territory is expected to hit about 47700 megawatts -- enough for nearly 48 million homes. The state's three main utility firms generate about 8200 megawatts and have long-term contracts from wind solar and other energy sources for about 11700 megawatts more. That totals about 20000 megawatts. Add in the 7000 megawatts of long-term power that Davis has announced for this summer and the state is still nearly 21000 megawatts short. Costly proposition If all that power has to be obtained on the spot market the price could be high. On Friday last-minute purchases on the market averaged $411 per megawatt-hour compared to about $150 per megawatt-hour for all power obtained by the Independent System Operator and $69 per megawatt-hour on average under Davis' long-term contracts. It's possible that not all 21000 megawatts would have to be purchased on the market. Assuming Davis is successful in getting people to save 10 percent -- which could prove difficult -- conservation could reduce peak demand by nearly 5000 megawatts. California also might be able to trade for another 5000 megawatts with the federal government's Bonneville Power Administration and a hydroelectric operator in British Columbia said Arthur O'Donnell editor of California Energy Markets a trade publication. Under such deals those two outfits often send that much power to California when they don't need it and California returns the same amount or more when its demand is low. But O'Donnell said it wasn't clear whether 5000 megawatts would be available this summer because ``they still haven't gotten the snowpack they need in the Pacific Northwest'' which could limit that region's generating capacity. Still falling short Even if those hydropower imports are available and conservation works as Davis hopes it's likely California would still require the spot market for 11000 megawatts to meet the August demand. That's more than 20 percent of the state's overall power needs. ``All of the surrounding states are buying probably less than 5 percent at most of their energy on the spot market'' said Frank Wolak a Stanford economist who monitors electricity prices for the Independent System Operator. He worries about how much that power could cost and is disturbed that state officials haven't adequately addressed the issue. ``No one has any idea what they are going to do and that is part of the problem'' he said. Officials at Pacific Gas & Electric Co. are particularly concerned. They fear that their company -- which is nearing bankruptcy -- could get stuck for much of the spot market purchases by the Independent System Operator which has threatened to bill the utilities for the cost. Fearing the annual bill for that power could hit $2.4 billion this year PG&E wants the tab sent to the Department of Water Resources which also is buying power on the spot market for the state. But the Department of Water Resources has objected to that idea and the matter is expected to be heard today by the California Public Utilities Commission. ``We're looking for clarity on a number of issues'' regarding how the spot market will work ``and certainly that's one of them'' said Thomas Hannigan the water agency's director. ``I don't think anybody knows the answer of who's going to pay for it'' added PG&E spokesman John Nelson. But Nettie Hoge executive director of the Utility Reform Network in San Francisco said she suspects consumers ultimately will foot the bill. The unfortunate likelihood about spot market purchases is that ``ratepayers are responsible for all of it eventually'' Hoge said. ``It's a very big problem.'' ---- Power Plant Plans Cause Conflicts East county residents blast supervisors Jason B. Johnson Chronicle Staff Writer Wednesday March 7 2001 Industry dreams of building new power plants in east Contra Costa's hills are prompting an angry reaction among residents and elected officials who say they don't want more plants. The conflict was sparked by a vote by county supervisors yesterday to aggressively explore possible sites for new power plants throughout the county. The measure by Supervisors Mark DeSaulnier and Federal Glover which passed on a 4-to-0 vote directs the county administrator and Department of Community Development to compile a report on possible sites within 45 days. Supervisor Donna Gerber abstained after criticizing the plan for potentially repeating the same mistakes that plagued the state's energy deregulation effort by not considering how much energy the state region and county will need in future years and how much power is slated to come online. Gerber said alternative power sources such as solar should also be examined. A site drawing much attention is on top of a deposit of natural gas near the Concord Naval Weapons Station off Highway 4. The owners of 70 acres of land near the station recently formed a company Golden State Power Co. to pursue construction of at least one small peaker plant and a much larger facility capable of producing 600 megawatts. The site could hold up to three small 50-megawatt peaker plants and a larger 15-acre natural gas plant said Steve Thomas managing partner with Golden State. No land use applications have been filed. Thomas said 30 acres could be kept as open space to form a buffer around the project. Both (facilities) are state of the art said Thomas. We believe that the site is ideal. But east county residents at yesterday's meeting blasted the supervisorial measure and the power plant proposal complaining that more plants could put people's health at risk. The region already is home to six power plants. We're going to get a good dose of poor air quality and (negative) health conditions from this said Concord resident Evelyn Frietas. I think we need to stop and think about what we're doing to our quality of life. Dan Torres said the home he bought in 1995 at a new Bay Point development would be alarmingly close to the proposed Golden State site. It will be dragging emissions over our home said Torres. I didn't buy a home on that hill to be surrounded by power plants. There are six power plants in operation in east Contra Costa. Pittsburg already has two power plants and two more under construction. City Council members Frank Aiello and Yvonne Beals said the Antioch-Pittsburg area has done more than its share of energy production. Aiello said Pittsburg will soon produce enough energy to power three million homes in California. When is enough enough? asked Aiello. Pittsburg has shouldered responsibility for a land-fill and two more power plants. At some point you have to say enough. Beals said that while power plants have added millions to the city's general fund the negatives of additional plants could outweigh the benefits. I don't think that Pittsburg or east county should be the dumping ground for energy for California said Beals. ---- Supervisors set search for power plant sites The board also heard from the potential developers of a 650-megawatt plant between Bay Point and Concord By Thomas Peele TIMES STAFF WRITER MARTINEZ -- Contra Costa County supervisors took tentative steps Tuesday toward allowing the construction of at least one small power plant before summer ordering that its staff identify potential sites in unincorporated areas within seven weeks. The board voted 4-0 to search for locations. Third District Supervisor Donna Gerber abstained saying her colleagues lacked a comprehensive context'' to identify sites. I think the board knows just enough to be dangerous'' she said. Gerber said the county should examine the potential for additional power plants within its borders but not investigate individual sites yet. But Fourth District Supervisor Mark DeSaulnier said the action was necessary because of the energy crisis and because of Gov. Gray Davis' call for local governments to help speed the construction of so-called peaker plants before July and August. I wouldn't do this except under an emergency DeSaulnier said after the vote. There are unusual circumstances. We're not talking about putting this in a residential area. Fifth District Supervisor Federal Glover backed DeSaulnier but said he hoped for a location outside his heavily industrialized East County district. There's a lot of concern in East County as to the number of plants he said. DeSaulnier said though that the only logical place for a small plant remains the industrial belt'' stretching along the waterfront from West County to Antioch. He declined to provide specifics but said the only other potential site outside the industrial areas was the Concord Naval Weapons Station property. But he quickly added that he believes the U.S. Department of Defense would never go for it. Also DeSaulnier said he could not rule out the county building the plant itself and entering the electricity-selling market during peak demand times. Board Chairwoman Gayle Uilkema called that idea extremely premature and unlikely. That's a very powerful decision. I do not think we are ready'' she said. The California Energy Commission listed the Equilon refinery in Martinez as one of 32 potential peaker plant sites in the state last week. Peaker plants kick in during peak usage times. Davis called for their quick construction before the height of summer and its energy demand for air conditioning. Plants that generate as much as 50000 megawatts don't need Energy Commission approval. DeSaulnier said he believed a peaker plant could be built about a month after final approval. Supervisors also heard from the potential developers of a 650-megawatt plant between Bay Point and Concord. Walnut Creek commercial real estate developer Steve Thomas announced his intentions for the site north of Highway 4 last week. Construction could take two years. Eric Hasseltine a consultant representing Thomas and what he described as a brand new company for the site the Golden State Power Co. told supervisors that if they intended to speed peaker plant construction they should do what they can to expedite the larger plant. The Thomas site could house a peaker plant until the proposed larger one goes online. A large natural gas line passes under the site. DeSaulnier seemed cautious about the larger proposal which he had described last week as a good site. Uilkema too said she knew too little about it to comment. A resident who lives near the Thomas property asked the board to build it (the larger plant) closer to where you have industrial areas. You have to carefully consider the people who live nearby said Dan Torres 39. Evelyn Freitas of Concord said she lives downwind of the proposed site. Our air quality is going to be worse then it is now she said. Gerber played on the environmental issues saying the county already ranks second statewide to Los Angeles in volume of hazardous materials and amount of electrical generation. ---- Peter Schrag: California's $90 billion infrastructure gap (Published March 7 2001) By now California's surreal energy mess has grown from a crisis to a condition. It may not be quite as permanent as say death and taxes but it's still something that could get a whole lot worse before it gets better. Until there's more realistic pricing no gubernatorial pea-under-the-shell buyout scheme will solve it. Beyond the energy crisis however and in many ways similar to it California faces a whole range of other infrastructure problems -- in transportation in water resources and sewer systems in school and university buildings -- that seem once again to be all but forgotten. The Business Roundtable has estimated the need at roughly $90 billion though no number can possibly be exact. What's certain is that after a burst of high-level investment in public facilities during the 1950s and 1960s California's annual capital investment has sunk precipitously -- from an annual $150 per capita in the 1960s according to a set of recent studies for PPIC the Public Policy Institute of California to about $30 in the 1990s. But you probably don't need to tell anyone driving Bay Area or Los Angeles freeways or looking at the ubiquitous portable classrooms those dreary brown boxes that house a fourth of our public school students. Ever since passage of Proposition 13 in 1978 we have been flying the flag of deferred maintenance. As in the state's electricity crisis however there's no way California can effectively address those problems merely by building or bonding itself out of them. In highway construction in developing water resources in finding enough university space to accommodate the Tidal Wave II of students managing demand is likely to be as crucial to any solution as new construction. In the energy market -- and in electricity particularly -- it's been a familiar principle ever since David Roe of the Environmental Defense Fund first persuaded Pacific Gas and Electric that a dollar invested in conservation may be worth as much as the same investment in new generation. But in most other sectors of California's infrastructure state and local it's a lesson still to be learned. There have been scattered attempts to encourage conservation and reduce demand -- significant reduction in water use for example through the installation of low-flow faucets and low-flush toilets some reduction in traffic by using rush-hour diamond lanes or by adjusting highway or (as in New York) bridge tolls to levels of congestion. But as pointed out by David Dowall an urban economist at Berkeley state policy-makers have not really begun to consider how demand management strategies can be applied to infrastructure service areas or how the more efficient use of facilities and more realistic pricing -- highway tolls say or parking fees -- can reduce demand for scarce infrastructure resources. In any case says Dowall in one of the PPIC reports we should pick which major projects we will build not just according to per capita estimates of how much we need but according to how much consumers are willing to pay for them. To avoid hurting the poor congestion-related highway tolls and other tariffs can be rebated on the basis of income. University fees can be means-tested. In California they also could be adjusted to encourage summer school classes and other off-peak uses rather than (as in the past) making UC summer courses more expensive. Given the political and economic uncertainties there's no way to know how far such demand management can be taken. But there's not much doubt that as Dowall and others point out the state's infrastructure planning is a jumble of uncoordinated agency agendas and wish lists. The Legislature last year passed a bill AB 1473 by Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg that requires the governor beginning next year to submit an annual five-year infrastructure plan for state agencies and public schools along with recommendations on how to fund it. In addition Gov. Gray Davis' infrastructure commission is expected to recommend better coordination of infrastructure and land-use planning when it issues its report this spring. That would be a start. As California State Treasurer Phil Angelides has pointed out the state desperately needs to start joint planning -- regional planning -- for housing roads and other resources to reduce the need for long commutes to preserve open space and to bring jobs to where people live and housing to where the jobs are. That would itself reduce demand for more freeway lanes and equally important improve the quality of life. At present most planning for housing roads water systems and other facilities rarely recognizes the regional impact of local decisions. In the East Bay slow-growth forces push well-intended initiatives that would force more development into Tracy or Modesto and further tax the transportation systems to Silicon Valley. In city after city there are beggar-thy-neighbor efforts to grab yet another shopping mall that produces a little extra sales tax revenue for the city that gets it and that often compounds traffic and revenue problems in adjacent communities. In higher education we divide bond proceeds evenly among UC the California State University and the community colleges even though the community colleges serve eight times as many students as UC. We plan road projects according to county not regional priorities. It is all done according to antiquated political and fiscal formulas that often no longer make sense. We don't just need better capital planning we need a whole new planning system. ---- PG&E power plan debated at hearing A PUC meeting on the utility's capacity expansion project for the Tri-Valley follows weeks of protest from officials residents Power upgrade in valley debated By Megan Long TIMES STAFF WRITER SAN FRANCISCO -- Dublin officials and the developer of a Livermore subdivision faced questions Tuesday about their opposition to alternative routes of PG&E's controversial Tri-Valley power upgrade plan -- and answered by restating their long-standing objections. Tuesday's cross-examination came during the third and likely final week of the California Public Utility Commission's evidentiary hearings on the utility's $91 million Tri-Valley 2002 Capacity Increase Project. It has followed weeks of protests of PG&E's upgrade plans by officials and residents of Livermore Pleasanton Dublin and San Ramon. And before the questioning started Dublin Vice Mayor Janet Lockhart reiterated concerns about an alternative route deemed environmentally superior that would place a substation just 1000 feet north of Interstate 580 between Tassajara and Fallon roads. She said that would undermine the results of a 15-year process to plan the eastern development of the city. It's extremely important to the residents of our community to follow a plan we worked hard to produce she said. Dublin officials favor PG&E's proposed placement of the station three miles north of the freeway away from new high-tech company offices and housing developments. Besides the Dublin substation the project calls for construction of a substation in North Livermore expansion of the Pleasanton substation and installation of 23.5 miles of new lines. In response to questions from PUC Administrative Law Judge Michelle Cooke Dublin's public works director Lee Thompson confirmed that the Lin family the owner of the property where the alternative substation would go wasn't interested in selling the land to PG&E. Cooke also asked Thompson to define a discretionary permit which is how city officials said they might treat a permit for a substation. Lee said that type of permit is one the city has the right to approve or not depending on the project's impact. Eddie Peabody Dublin's community development director testified that the zoning for the Lin property accommodates uses such as commercial business research and development and light manufacturing. It would not he said be appropriate for a power substation. He said parcels within the East Dublin area that could host a station would include those zoned for public and semi-public uses including land recently bought by Oracle and Sun Microsystems for new campuses. While Dublin officials testified that one buyer of land in that area paid $86 per square foot others suggested land prices would be inflated to help make a PG&E land buy look prohibitively expensive. An executive of Centex Homes the developer of new houses near Isabel Avenue and Concannon Boulevard objected to an alternative route that would place high-voltage transmission lines overhead along Isabel and Stanley Boulevard. David Barclay president of Centex's Northern California division said that the 80-foot to 150-foot towers would have a severe visual impact on residents of the Prima tract. Ed O'Neill a lawyer for the Kottinger Ranch Homeowners Association pointed out that existing distribution lines on 50-foot poles on Isabel already mar the view for residents. The Foley family has been ranching on land south of Pleasanton city limits for years said their attorney Kennedy Richardson. The utility's project would place overhead lines and a transmission station on rolling hills that the family envisions as one day being public open space with limited development Richardson said. Lawyers for Pleasanton Livermore Kottinger Ranch and Centex are scheduled to cross-examine a PG&E engineer today about the project's routing. That testimony should be the most controversial of the hearings. Judge Cooke is expected to recommend an alignment by July to the PUC which will make the final decision. ---- NEWS State OKs 'Peaker' Power Plant at SFO / Temporary generator could be sending electricity to 50000 homes by August Marshall Wilson 03/08/2001 The San Francisco Chronicle FINAL Page A.20 (Copyright 2001) State energy officials yesterday approved plans to build a temporary electrical plant at San Francisco International Airport that should generate enough juice to power 50000 homes by August. Meeting in Sacramento the Energy Commission voted 4-0 to give the green light to the gas-fired plant. It will operate during peak summer and winter demand to help the state avoid Stage 3 power alerts and rolling blackouts. Texas-based El Paso Merchant Energy Co. won approval under a new state law mandating speedy four-month reviews of so-called peaker plants. It was the only one of seven applications statewide to win approval. The other proposals were withdrawn for various reasons. The 51-megawatt plant formally called the United Golden Gate Power Project is scheduled to be built at the northwest corner of the airport near the United Airlines maintenance center. Within the next few weeks El Paso plans to apply to build a 571- megawatt $400 million plant in the same area company spokesman Jesse Frederick said. It would undergo a separate review by state energy officials. The small peaker plant approved yesterday is to generate electricity beginning around Aug. 1 for up to three years. After the end of three years the plant would be closed or converted to a cleaner-burning system. Under state law a temporary peaker plant is permitted to spew more air pollution than a permanent plant. El Paso's temporary plant is to be built next to a co-generation plant operated by United Airlines. It would use existing connections for natural gas and water supplies and tap into existing power transmission lines. Electricity generated by the plant would be pumped into the state's electrical grid Energy Commission spokesman Gary Fay said. It would also serve as a backup for San Francisco Airport in case of a blackout. No one spoke against the proposed plant at yesterday's commission meeting. The proposal however has been criticized by area residents and environmentalists worried about air pollution. Scott Buschman a professional photographer and San Bruno resident said yesterday it was unjust that state officials 100 miles away in Sacramento approved a Texas company's proposal to put a power plant on land owned by San Francisco. The fact that they approved it without considering the public's concerns foremost air quality is very disturbing he said. Fay said the plant complies with clean-air standards. Answering the criticism about the location of yesterday's deliberation he said three hearings and several workshops were held in communities near the airport. Copyright  2000 Dow Jones & Company Inc. All Rights Reserved. ---- Crossed Wires: Major Kinks Emerge In Gov. Davis's Plan To Power California --- State's Outlays for Electricity May Be Hard to Recover Without Rate Increases --- Betting on Long-Term Deals By Wall Street Journal staff reporters Rebecca Smith Mitchel Benson and John R. Emshwiller 03/08/2001 The Wall Street Journal A1 (Copyright (c) 2001 Dow Jones & Company Inc.) SACRAMENTO Calif. -- Earlier this year Gov. Gray Davis made what may be the biggest bet in the history of the nation's biggest state: that he could tame an out-of-control electricity market and avoid devastating blackouts without busting the state's budget antagonizing its consumers or derailing his own political career. His wager is still on the table but the assumptions that underlie it are looking increasingly shaky these days. The governor has already spent around $2 billion of public money buying hugely expensive wholesale power taking over the role formerly played by the state's near-bankrupt electric utilities. And California will probably be obliged to spend billions more before its electricity market stabilizes and those utilities are restored to some semblance of financial health. Under the governor's plan California aims to recoup the money it is using to buy electricity by issuing $10 billion in bonds. That way it would still have a healthy budget surplus to finance new spending on roads schools and other public services. But there's a potentially big obstacle to this plan. The state Legislature worried about racking up billions in new debt has put limits on the size of any bond offering. In broad terms the Legislature's action would allow the state to borrow only four times as much as it can recover annually from utility customers. Right now that doesn't appear to be much. Under the current rate structure essentially set in place by California's flawed 1996 electricity-deregulation plan consumers pay far less for power than the cost of acquiring it on the wholesale market. Preliminary estimates submitted by utilities last month to the California Public Utilities Commission show the state's share of the proceeds from electricity sales this year could be as little as $241 million -- not enough to support even $1 billion in bond sales under the Legislature's formula. That would leave the state on the hook for much of the money it has already paid for power -- not to mention the billions more Gov. Davis will need to spend. That in turn raises the prospect that California's economy and its credit rating both could deteriorate significantly. But state finance officials say that based on their own projections they will be able to extract enough money to support a $10 billion bond issue. Walking a careful line between fiscal prudence and political survival Mr. Davis and others in his administration are scrambling to come up with ways to get around the legislative restrictions without raising rates for consumers. If I wanted to raise rates I could solve this problem in 20 minutes Mr. Davis says. The governor says he believes that the state can obtain enough affordable power through long-term power-supply contracts to avoid the need for a big rate increase. The billions of dollars the state hopes to borrow would be used to help pay for power until electricity prices drop as they are expected to do when new power plants come online over the next few years. The Davis administration fears that what may be its only other option -- a big increase in retail electric rates -- could prompt angry consumer groups to seek new electricity laws through a statewide ballot initiative during next year's election. That's when Mr. Davis is expected to run for a second term as governor. But trying to save California without rate increases is forcing Mr. Davis to make some colossal gambles with the state's money. State officials estimate that in the next several months California will need to spend as much as $6 billion on power purchases -- equivalent to the state's entire fiscal surplus. Mr. Davis is also looking to spend several billion more to buy the transmission assets of three investor-owned utilities in order to restore two of them to credit-worthiness. He also has announced plans to spend several hundred million dollars more on conservation programs designed to reduce demand while new power plants are being built in the state. In order to limit the state's financial exposure in the meantime the governor and his aides have in some cases ignored state law. They have threatened appointed officials who have stood in the way. And they have sharply restricted the flow of information to the public. None of those steps is expected to do much to reduce state spending on power in the coming months. In a few weeks power usage is expected to begin a sharp seasonal rise as Californians switch on their air conditioners with the coming of warmer weather. By various estimates demand during peak periods this summer could outstrip supply by 10% or several thousand megawatts. That could produce more rolling blackouts like the ones that hit Northern California earlier this year. It is also likely to put strong upward pressure on wholesale electricity prices. Steven Zimmerman managing director of Standard & Poor's Corp. says Mr. Davis and his aides don't have a lot of time to put a cap on the state's financial exposure to the crisis. The credit-rating agency has put the state on credit watch for a possible downgrade which would affect the value of all of California's outstanding public debt. Moody's Investor Service Inc. is also concerned. It said in a recent report that the power crisis could soon seriously threaten the health of the state's economy. Mr. Davis a Democrat and career politician was dealt a bad hand when he took office in 1999. The deregulation plan that sparked the state's electricity crisis was enacted under his predecessor Republican Pete Wilson. But Mr. Davis was slow to react to early signs of trouble this past summer and alarms sounded by members of the state Legislature. By the time Mr. Davis finally sprang into action earlier this year a troublesome power-supply squeeze had escalated into a crisis. In a Jan. 17 declaration of emergency the governor designated the state Department of Water Resources to take the utilities' place as the daily buyer of huge quantities of electricity. His hope: that by making the state the dominant player in California's power sector he would ease electricity producers' concerns about getting paid and give the state enough clout to negotiate lower long-term power prices. Earlier this week Mr. Davis announced final or tentative agreements with 20 power suppliers to furnish the state with a total of 8900 megawatts for periods of as long as 20 years. But the supply situation remains extremely uncertain for this summer when demand probably will top 45000 megawatts. If the state can secure enough power under contract and push down demand through aggressive conservation it might be able to squeak through the summer season. If not it will be forced to keep buying huge amounts of costly power in the cash market. Under deregulation retail electric rates were frozen for several years while wholesale-power costs were free to fluctuate. When the plan was conceived wholesale prices were low and expected to go lower. However a combination of unexpected growth in power demand and a lack of new generating capacity helped produce a supply squeeze. Average wholesale prices more than tripled last year from 1999. And in January those prices were up 10-fold from a year earlier. By then California's two biggest investor-owned utilities -- the Pacific Gas & Electric unit of PG&E Corp. and the Southern California Edison subsidiary of Edison International -- faced imminent financial collapse. They had racked up billions of dollars in wholesale power bills they couldn't afford to pay. As generators began shying away from selling to the two utilities the Clinton administration forced them to sell power into the California market an order left in place during the first weeks of the Bush administration. Still northern California was hit by rolling blackouts on several days in early January. Since then the DWR which does some electricity trading as an adjunct to its main mission of managing the state's giant system of aqueducts and reservoirs has had to learn the ins and outs of power markets on the run. It hasn't been easy. David Mills trading-floor manager for the federal Bonneville Power Administration says the water agency has at times offered to pay $50 to $100 per megawatt hour more than the available market price. They agree to prices that make you wonder says Mr. Mills whose organization markets electricity from federal dams in the Pacific Northwest. You'd at least think they'd check to see what the prevailing price is before throwing out their offer. Mr. Mills says that to cut California some slack he occasionally has instructed his traders to sell at prices lower than the DWR had offered to pay. Ray Hart the water agency deputy director responsible for the power purchasing says he isn't aware of any cases in which the DWR has overpaid. He says his team has been extremely successful by all measures. Ultimately the DWR's trading acumen is far less important than the overall arithmetic of power supply and demand in California. With the price of natural gas that feeds many of the region's generating plants at near record levels and some suppliers reluctant to sell into the troubled California market wholesale electric prices remain stubbornly high and in recent days have again been rising. The Legislature has advanced the DWR about $3 billion from the state's general fund for power purchases. Under emergency legislation passed by the Legislature and signed by Mr. Davis on Feb. 1 the general fund is to be reimbursed from a planned bond sale later this year. But under terms of the emergency law the water agency would have to wrest $2.5 billion a year in revenue from retail electricity rates in order to sell the $10 billion worth of bonds sought by Mr. Davis. Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg a Southern California Democrat says the formula was created to ensure that there would be a way to repay the bonds without draining the state's coffers. We didn't want to just open our wallets he says. According to the language of the Feb. 1 law the water agency gets what's left of revenue collected from ratepayers after the utilities pay certain of their own power-supply bills and other expenses. And in their filings with the PUC last month the utilities reckoned under their worst-case scenarios that there would be only $241 million available to the DWR this year. State officials are quietly pushing the PUC to rejigger the formula so that the water department gets more money -- even though that would clash with terms of the Feb. 1 law. Robert Miyashiro deputy director of the Department of Finance says the emergency law was drafted poorly and has led people to believe the DWR only gets the leftover money. He predicts there will be cleanup legislation. At the request of the Davis administration the PUC is considering a plan to use a different revenue-sharing formula than the one in the state law. The proposed new formula was written in close consultation with Mr. Davis's Finance Department says PUC President Loretta Lynch who supports the initiative and is hoping to rush it through. The effort has drawn some opposition. Commissioner Richard Bilas at a recent PUC meeting questioned the legality of the commission attempting to change a formula set by the Legislature. PG&E is even more emphatic since the DWR's extra money could come at the utility's expense. The formula threatens to undo the very financial protections for the utilities that [the new law] attempted to provide the utility said in a recent filing with the PUC. As politicians and regulators wrestle with that issue the Davis administration has taken a step to reduce the outflow of state cash that also seems to conflict with the Feb. 1 law. It was widely assumed that the law required the DWR to buy any electricity the state needed to keep its lights on. However on many occasions the DWR has refused to buy power on the grounds that it was too expensive citing a portion of the new law that urges the agency to hold down costs. The task of covering any remaining shortfall has passed to the California Independent System Operator which manages the state's energy grid and is charged with buying power when necessary to avert shortages. However the ISO doesn't have any power-purchasing money of its own and the major parties it would normally bill are PG&E and Edison whose inability to pay their power bills was the reason the state started buying electricity in the first place. Amid criticism of its stance from generators utilities and Wall Street the DWR says it has started covering more of the utilities' electricity costs. The water agency is now buying 95% to 99% of what California needs in a given day says the agency's Mr. Hart. But increased buying only adds to the uncertainty about the eventual tab. The state's legislative analyst Elizabeth Hill recently recommended that lawmakers hold off considering more than $2 billion in state spending on items ranging from college construction to beach cleanups because of continuing questions about the financial impact of the electricity crisis. Like others Ms. Hill complains that the governor's office and state agencies haven't been forthcoming with information. Indeed the DWR refuses to say precisely how much power it is purchasing and at what prices though it has on several occasions gone back to the Legislature for more money. State officials say that data on its purchasing activities would give suppliers an advantage in continuing electricity-supply contract talks. State Controller Kathleen Connell who is running for mayor of Los Angeles in an April election recently announced plans to post state power-spending information on her department's Web site. But within 24 hours Ms. Connell suspended that plan after discussions with senior Davis administration officials. I feel very strongly that this information should be publicly released says Ms. Connell. I just don't want to do anything that would weaken the state's effectiveness in negotiating. In an effort to more tightly control events the governor obtained legislative approval to abolish the 26-member ISO board which was made up of everyone from utility executives to representatives of consumer groups. He then appointed a new five-member board. To ensure a quick transition the California attorney general threatened the old board members with fines of as much as $5000 each if they didn't immediately relinquish their positions. All did. I was offended at the heavy-handed treatment says Karen Johanson a former ISO board member. One of the first acts of the ISO's new board was to close a meeting about the electricity crisis. The former ISO board routinely held such meetings in public. ISO attorneys say the meeting was largely designed as a private briefing for new board members and that the organization is committed to keeping its deliberations as open as possible. The Wall Street Journal and other news organizations have unsuccessfully challenged the closure in Sacramento state court. Copyright  2000 Dow Jones & Company Inc.

26,A Supportive Note,Dear Mr. Lay: I'm writing this note to you as a show of support to you during your dire times. The reason that I share this with you is my respect for you as a CEO a business leader and a person. My wife is one of your employees who routinely shares stories about you that are nothing less than inspiring. I know that during difficult times sometimes words emerge that can help people through difficult times. I believe that you are sincere man and know that you must be broken hearted but I hope that this article can help you lead a dispirted workforce to see things more clearly. My wife Shelly Pierce has worked for Enron for the past two years and like many of your employees has lost a great deal of her life savings. Of course I accept most of the blame for this for reasons related to this article. I lost my investment discipline and held out the false hope that Enron could not falter. After reading the article to her while I was out of town I believe that her spirit was a bit rejuvenated and she was ready to face the challenges that lay before you. Mr. Lay I appreciate the opportunity that you have given my wife and our family and hope that this story inspires you to regain your successes. From the USA Today Tuesday November 27 2001 page 15A. In recession face brutal facts thrive By Jim Collins A man in his early 20s recently asked me So what's a recession like? Its an entirely alien concept to him he'd grown up during the greatest economic boom in modern memory. His question drove home the fact that we haven't faced a severe protracted economic setback for nearly 2 decades leaving us terribly unpracticed at dealing with tough times. With this recession - long in coming perhaps long to stay - now officially upon us it is imperative that corporate leaders relearn a key lesson about how great companies (and great people) deal with difficult times differently from how they deal with merely good ones. That lesson is the Stockdale Paradox a peculiar psychology shown by those who emerge from tough times not just intact but stronger. Adm. Jim Stockdale was the highest-ranking U.S. military officer in the Hanoi prison camp during the Vietnam War. Tortured many times during his 8-year imprisonment Stockdale lived without any prisoner's rights no set release date and no certainty as to whether he would ever again see his family. He shouldered the burden of command while fighting an internal war against his captors and their attempts to use the prisoners for propaganda. At one point he beat himself with a stool and cut himself with a razor deliberately disfiguring himself so that he could not be put on video as an example of a well-treated prisoner. He exchanged secret intelligence information with his wife through their letters knowing that discovery would mean more torture and perhaps death. After his release Stockdale became the first three-star officer in the history of the Navy to wear both aviator wings and the Congressional Medal of Honor. You can understand then my anticipation at the prospect of spending part of an afternoon with Stockdale who happened to be at the Hoover Institute across the street from my office when I taught at Stanford. In preparation I read In Love and War the book he and his wife wrote to chronicle their experiences those 8 years. As I read the book I found myself getting depressed. It just seemed so bleak - the uncertainty of his fate the brutality of his captors. And then it dawned on me: Here I am sitting in my warm comfortable office looking out over the Stanford campus on a beautiful Saturday afternoon. I'm getting depressed reading this and I know that he gets out reunites with his family and becomes a national hero. If it feels depressing for me how on earth did he deal with it when he was actually there and did not know the end of the story? I never lost faith in the end of the story Stockdale said when I asked him. I never doubted not only that I would get out but also that I would prevail in the end and turn the experience into the defining event of my life that in retrospect I would not trade. I didn't say anything for many minutes and we continued the slow walk toward the faculty club Stockdale limping and arc-swinging his leg still stiff from repeated torture. Finally I asked Who didn't make it out? Oh that's easy he said. The optimists. The optimists? I don't understand I said completely confused. The optimists. Oh they were the ones who said 'We're going to be out by Christmas.' And Christmas would come and Christmas would go. Then they'd say 'We're going to be out by Easter.' And Easter would come and Easter would go. And then Thanksgiving and then it would be Christmas again. And they died of a broken heart. After another long pause he turned to me and said This is a very important lesson. You must never confuse faith that you will prevail in the end - which you can never afford to lose - with the need for discipline to confront the most brutal facts of your current reality whatever they might be. My conversation with Stockdale had a profound influence on me but I never really considered it a business lesson until my research team began to wrestle with the question of why some companies rise from difficulty to become great while others emerge from those exact same difficulties weakened and dispirited. We found that companies that became great embraced a corporate version of the Stockdale Paradox. Fannie Mae for example found itself in the 1982 recession losing $1M every business day with $56B in loans under water. Many analysts thought Fannie Mae which was getting 9% on its mortgage portfolio but paying 15% on the debt it issued was doomed. But CEO David Maxwell and his team never wavered in their aim to not merely survive but also to prevail as a great company. Yes they confronted the brutal fact that the interest-rate problem was not going to magically disappear (certainly not by Christmas). But they used this grim fact as a catalyst for creating an entirely new business model based on asking three central questions of greatness: What can we potentially do better than any other company in the world? What can best drive our economic engine? What best ignites the passions of our people? Instead of reacting to the recession with mindless restructuring Fannie Mae rebuilt itself based on its answers to these questions. Eventually it generated investor returns nearly eight times those of the general stock market. When asked how he dealt with the nay Sayers and the analysts who wrote Fannie Mae off Maxwell said that it was never an issue inside the company. Of course we had to stop doing a lot of stupid things but we never entertained the possibility that we would fail. We were going to use the calamity as an opportunity to remake Fannie Maw into a great company. The sad truth is that most executive teams won't respond that way to these dark days of uncertainty. Instead of using this recession as an opportunity to fundamentally rethink their business and rebuild a culture of discipline the will simply restructure lay off a bunch of people and liquidate their cultural equity. Mediocre leaders will hold out false hopes for a quick fix only to watch those hopes be swept away by events. Their companies will begin to die of a broken heart. It need not be this way. Those who lead with the Stockdale Paradox - those who retain the unwavering faith that they will find a way to prevail in the end but who also retain the discipline to confront the most brutal facts of reality - will find this an ideal time to rebuild and reinforce greatness. Used correctly this recession can be a defining time in your firm's history that  in retrospect you would not trade. Used wrongly this recession will weaken your foundations and make it that much harder to become great. The choice is yours.

Thanks again David Merrill@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 09/09/2000 05:59 AM To: Steven J Kean/NA/Enron@Enron cc: Subject: Fletcher School/Enron Dear Steve: Last month while at my reunion at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University some of the school officials told me that Enron has hired about eight Fletcher graduates recently and is happy with them. The school is also happy and wants to strengthen its relationship with Enron. They had earlier this year contacted a Laura Kalmans Director of Community Development at Enron to discuss various ideas for cooperation with Enron that would strengthen our capacity in environmental matters and give the students exposure to real world issues but nothing happened and they lost contact. They asked me who they should contact to find out how to pursue this and I said I thought it might be you or someone under you. They now want to send a letter to someone at Enron on this proposal. It is OK if it is addressed to you or should I tell them another name? Please advise me how to steer them in the right direction. Many thanks.

69,Update on House RTO Activities,There are now two House hearnigs tomorrow not just one. In the morning there is a panel on reliability siting and incentive pricing for transmission. Jim Steffes is the EPSA witness. The RTO-related hearing originally scheduled on a separate day will be in the afternoon tomorrow. Peter Esposito of Dynegy is the expected EPSA witness. I am checking on the final list of other panelists and will advise. Finally Andy Black of Chairman Barton's staff advises that they will release draft RTO language as early as today. We expect that this draft will not be to our liking. Barton thinks FERC is moving too quickly and with too much force. We expect his proposal to set a deadline of something like 12 months for utilities to join an RTO. The key is in part whether he allows FERC to continue to decide what constitutes an acceptable RTO or whether he will try to grandfather in some fashion those RTOs that have been proposed by utilities to date.,"RTOs; Hearings; Legislation; FERC

70,,Mike - perhaps you can help me or forward this on to someone who can. The people in my organization support all the Enron business units but many are specifically dedicated to certain business units. As a consequence we have ended up on a variety of LANs with a variety of support people. Due to the fine efforts of your team many people in my group have migrated over to the Enron Corp LAN. We are also now enjoying great support from Russell & Russell (Servat and Mitchell). As the IT guy I'm sure you are accustomed to such profuse praise. However many of the people on my team (including me) are on the EES LAN. Historically EES has supported us with the equipment we need and they too have been doing a fine job in that regard. Historically therefore we have not budgeted for IT .... a practice which will change starting next year. In the meantime when we sought to migrate the rest of my organization to the CORP LAN we were told that we would have to pay for all of our current equipment or give it back to EES. If you need me to I can explain in detail why this makes no sense.,"IT; LAN; Enron; Budget

72,Draft Response to CPUC OII,I have taken a stab at putting a draft response together indicating areas where we need more flesh. I will forward Tim/Mary's presentation to FERC EPSA's California Fact Sheet and the transcript from the hearing held on 8/23 and 8/24. Witness Wolak Market Surveillance Committee of ISO had some good points about rational behavior in markets with scarcity of supply. His comments were on 8/23. Please feel free to comment. Dan Douglass Arter&Hadden (818-596-2201) will be filing these comments on Enron's behalf which are due on Friday. I would suggest that Dan provide some of the legal view on whether the CPUC has adequate jurisdiction over retail rates not wholesale rates. We should shoot for final comments by 10:00 a.m. tomorrow if possible. This will allow an opportunity to discuss any last minute changes if necessary before filing. Seabron Adamson Frontier Economics (617-354-0060) will be providing additional drafting. Be sure to send any comments to these parties along with the internal list.

Davis's Plan To Power California --- State's Outlays for Electricity May Be Hard to Recover Without Rate Increases --- Betting on Long-Term Deals ------------------------ Breakthrough made in rescue of PG&E State ready to pay $7 billion for lines By Steve Geissinger SACRAMENTO BUREAU SACRAMENTO -- Signaling a breakthrough in secret energy crisis talks the Davis administration disclosed Tuesday it may announce the framework of a pact to rescue the teetering Pacific Gas and Electric Co. next week. Things are going very well said Steve Maviglio a spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis. The state appears to be poised to pay at least $7 billion -- and possibly billions more -- for PG&E's high-voltage transmission lines as part of a deal to financially renovate the north-state utility according to sources familiar with the negotiations. But consumer advocates insisted that even the $7 billion price is too much to pay. And experts warned that a deal with PG&E will be more complex than with other utilities. PG&E representatives declined comment in keeping with their policy on the talks even though the Davis administration said an announcement could come as early as next week or the following week. The new timetable for an announcement was substantially sooner than in Davis' original forecast. Until late last week PG&E was still resisting the sale of its power grid despite the fact that Davis had announced the framework of an agreement with Southern California Edison. Davis expects to soon announce a similar deal with the San Diego Gas and Electric Co. However any such deal still would need federal approval. The investor-owned utilities trapped between high wholesale costs and lower regulated retail rates amassed nearly $13 billion in debts and were unable to buy electricity this winter. With the onset of rolling blackouts the state began brokering billions of dollars in emergency short- and long-term power purchases. Davis' strategy to ease the energy price and supply crisis includes bolstering both conservation and generation while fiscally refurbishing the nearly bankrupt utilities. As part of the rescue deal the utilities would have to drop legal actions seeking dramatically higher electricity bills environmentally shield wildlands they own sell power from their generators to Californians for the next decade and secure help with their debts from their parent companies. Together with the cash infusion from the sale of their power 26000-mile power grids the utilities would be allowed to sell bonds to raise funds and use customer money to pay them off. The state would upgrade the high-voltage lines and lease them back to the utilities for operation. In a reflection of the negotiations with the three utilities a Davis administration official said the deal with PG&E is proving to be more complex than with the other firms. Though PG&E finally agreed late last week to sell its transmission grid the utility apparently wants more than the $7 billion that Davis has offered according to sources. The figure is more than twice the book amount or the value placed on the system for purposes of accounting. And that's the markup that lured Edison into an agreement to sell its smaller portion of the transmission grid for $2.8 billion. But PG&E which fears an erosion of its economic base may be asking as much as $10 billion. Due to complexities in the state's 1996 deregulation of the industry PG&E is more likely to lose revenue than Edison as a result of selling its transmission lines according to experts. Big customers might be able to bypass the utility's remaining local distribution lines thereby eroding its customer base. Therefore the utility may view bankruptcy and sale of its transmission lines to the highest bidder as a potentially attractive alternative to selling its share of the grid to the state at too low a price. ---- El Paso Energy closes six valley power plants Filed: 03/07/2001 By CHIP POWER Californian staff writer e-mail: ppower@bakersfield.com El Paso Energy citing non-payment from Pacific Gas & Electric Co. said it has shut down six cogeneration plants this week. The smaller plants produced about 175 megawatts of electricity and are located primarily in the San Joaquin Valley said company spokesman Mel Scott. A megawatt can supply power to 1000 homes. At least 10 plants have closed in the past two weeks as a result of non-payment according to the state Independent System Operator which manages most of the state's electrical distribution. The El Paso Energy plants are operated with various partners and had not been compensated for December January and February deliveries said Scott. He said he did not know the total amount due but said the plants would be closed until PG&E's credit worthiness is improved. A cogeneration plant common in oil fields simultaneously produces heat energy and electrical or mechanical power from the same fuel in the same facility. Typically it produces electricity and steam which can be deployed to enhance oil recovery. Kern County is the state's leading oil-producing county. El Paso owns or has interests in more than 40000 miles of interstate and intrastate pipeline connecting the nation's principal natural gas supply regions to the five largest consuming regions in the United States namely the Gulf Coast California the Northeast the Midwest and the Southeast. El Paso closed up 99 cents on Tuesday or 1.4 percent at $71.49. The Houston-based company's stock price has ranged between $36.31 and $75.30 in the last 52 weeks. ---- Still undecided: Who'll pay DWR for electricity By Karen Gaudette ASSOCIATED PRESS SAN FRANCISCO -- The price tag is $3.2 billion and counting for electricity bought by the state Department of Water Resources for the customers of two nearly bankrupt utilities. Pacific Gas and Electric Co. Southern California Edison and the state disagree over how the DWR eventually will be reimbursed for its purchases on the expensive last-minute power market. So do the state power regulators who have the final call over who gets the money when. Under a recent law the DWR went into the electricity-buying business to help keep the two utilities from sinking further into their $13 billion debt. The state plans to retrieve the money by selling $10 billion in revenue bonds. The utilities continue to collect ratepayer dollars on that electricity which the bill's author Assemblyman Fred Keeley D-Boulder Creek says is meant to help them begin paying down their debt. In a recent letter however DWR officials requested that the state Public Utilities Commission order that a portion of that money be diverted to the state. But after the utilities subtract the costs of generating electricity payments to environmentally friendly power plants and other expenses there is no money left from ratepayer dollars to give to the DWR without sinking further into debt PG&E spokesman Ron Low said Tuesday. If it passed along money to the DWR our undercollection would grow by about $2.4 billion by the end of the year Low said. The commission unable to agree on the best course of action left the issue untouched at its last meeting but expects to revisit the issue when it meets this morning. Commissioner Richard Bilas is proposing an alternate plan that would have the DWR set its own revenue requirements that would be passed on to ratepayers. The PUC also is expected to respond to complaints from laid-off workers and customers that layoffs by utilities to cut costs have been hurting service. Commissioner Carl Wood warned at the last meeting that failure to provide safe and reliable service could mean fines for the utilities. Representatives from electrical workers unions the PUC and the utilities were to discuss the issue Tuesday afternoon. I don't think we believe that utilities can find a way out of their problems by laying off workers said Mindy Spatt a spokeswoman with the Utility Reform Network. We think consumers deserve safe and reliable service and we think they deserve it at a reasonable price. ---- State Taxpayers In Dark on Details Of Energy Deal David Lazarus Chronicle Staff Writer Wednesday March 7 2001 2001 San Francisco Chronicle Few people would purchase a car simply because the dealer said ''Trust me it's a great deal.'' Yet Gov. Gray Davis essentially is telling Californians just that about dozens of long-term power contracts. Because of confidentiality agreements with power companies the governor has revealed only scant details about the state's multibillion-dollar contracts for electricity over the next 10 years. Gov. Davis has our money and we can't see how he's spending it said Doug Heller a spokesman for the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in Santa Monica. We've been locked out of the room. Neither Davis nor power companies would divulge specific details about the price duration or scope of individual contracts. Each cited secrecy clauses that the governor's office said had been desired by both sides. What consumers do know is this: -- California has signed 40 contracts and tentative accords valued at about $40 billion to secure enough power to light 9 million homes over the next decade. -- The average purchase price of each deal is $69 per megawatt hour -- well above the $30 to $40 charged by power generators before California's energy market went haywire last summer. -- If as is widely expected wholesale power prices fall in years ahead the state nevertheless will be locked into paying above-market rates for electricity. But it is not known which generator agreed to part with the most power at the cheapest level or the full range of the prices in concocting the $69 average. Moreover it is unclear how shrewdly the state negotiated with taxpayer money in securing power on behalf of cash-strapped utilities. These agreements are the bedrock of our long-term energy policy Davis said Monday in announcing the deals. The governor's office defended the murky nature of the contracts yesterday. It's a business transaction in which private corporate information is included said Steve Maviglio a spokesman for Davis. That's the kind of information that never gets revealed. While additional elements of the contracts will be publicized in coming months he said the contracts themselves will remain a secret. You'll never see all the details Maviglio said. This did not sit well with many observers. It's a breach of public trust said Daniel Bacon a San Francisco attorney specializing in business law. A public servant spending public money shouldn't be able to keep the spending secret. But Gary Ackerman executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum an energy-industry association in Menlo Park called confidentiality agreements a necessary evil in transactions like this. He explained that no power company would agree to a long-term contract if rival firms could learn the terms of the accord. The company would be losing too much of its competitive edge in the marketplace Ackerman said. At the same time he noted that secrecy allowed the buyer -- in this case California taxpayers -- to secure more favorable terms with individual sellers. A high price with one generator would not necessarily be sought by all power providers. Still the fact that public funds are being used makes confidentiality in this case a different matter than say Cisco Systems' quietly negotiating to take over yet another tech rival. The public is in a very awkward position said Michael Shames executive director of the Utility Consumers' Action Network in San Diego. It has to rely on the good word and expertise of the governor and he has yet to demonstrate that he has expertise or good word in this field. Shames likened consumers to passengers in a plane being flown by a pilot without a license to fly. But what choice do we have? he asked. I don't see many other options available right now. There's the rub. No matter how bad a deal California may have cut to help meet its energy demands the alternative -- blackouts disruptions economic catastrophe -- is far far worse. On the other hand it already appears that the new contracts will not shield Californians from the threat of daily outages this summer when demand surges. Davis said only about 60 percent of the state's summertime electricity needs so far had been met. Part of the reason is that many power companies already have contracted for their output this year. Duke Energy said this was why it would not begin its nine-year contract with California until 2002 while Williams Cos. said it would only gradually increase the amount of available wattage in its 10-year contract. Both companies meanwhile will continue to profit this summer by selling into the volatile spot market where wholesale power went for as much as $1 500 per megawatt hour last year. You can't sell all your power into long-term contracts said Paula Hall- Collins a Williams spokeswoman. You save some for the spot market. Consumer groups worry that consumers will be hammered again this summer with sky-high power prices and then get nailed down the road by contracts for above-market rates. If we could look at the terms of the deals we'd see that California is being gouged for 10 years said Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights. But the governor doesn't want us to see that. Ackerman of the Western Power Trading Forum said the state had gotten the best rates it could under current market conditions. California went for long-term contracts when everyone else moved in as well he said. Californians are paying a price for not acting sooner. ---- Lawmakers pitch fixes for region's energy woes By David Whitney Bee Washington Bureau (Published March 7 2001) WASHINGTON -- California members of Congress pleaded for everything from wholesale price caps to extending daylight-saving time an extra hour to help the region cope this summer with its persistent electricity shortage but none of the ideas seemed to catch fire at a House hearing Tuesday. People will die in California because of this crisis Rep. Brad Sherman a Los Angeles-area Republican warned the House Energy and Commerce Committee. Sherman testified that his idea for saving lives is to extend daylight-saving time by an extra hour so that there would be more daylight at the end of the day when power consumption surges. One of the peak demand periods for electricity occurs between 5 p.m. and 8 p.m. when the sun sets and people come home from work Sherman testified. If people come home and it is light out there is less of an inclination to turn a light on. Sherman said the state Legislature has called for congressional approval for states to be given authority to extend daylight-saving time and he cited analyses by the California Energy Commission and other agencies suggesting that it could cut power consumption by 1 percent to 2 percent. Sherman who was one of about a dozen California lawmakers presenting their views on the energy squeeze drew no questions from committee leaders about what his legislation might do to everything from airline schedules to television programming if West Coast states didn't agree on the same time standard. Most of the committee's questioning was on the more popular idea proposed by several California and Western lawmakers primarily Democrats to require the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to impose caps on wholesale electricity prices that have gone wild because of a regional power shortage. Rep. Bob Filner D-San Diego charged that the price spiral has little to do with power shortages but a lot to do with a small cartel of generators bilking ratepayers. Rep. Jay Inslee D-Wash. said he brought up the idea of regional price caps with President Bush who was initially skeptical. But Inslee said that Bush warmed to the idea after being told that protections could be built into the caps so as not to discourage construction of new power plants. Upon hearing that Inslee said Bush invited him to meet with the president's Cabinet-level task force led by Vice President Dick Cheney on a national energy strategy. But Inslee said he can't get the group to meet with him. It's very disappointing Inslee said. Tuesday's hearing was part of a series the panel is holding on the California crisis so far without any emerging consensus on what if anything Congress should do. ---- Power plan called wrong Wall Street analysts say the governor's approach to the problem avoids the issue that caused the imbalance. March 7 2001 By DON THOMPSON The Associated Press SACRAMENTO California's scramble to insulate consumers from the soaring price of electricity may add to the state's power problems this summer Wall Street analysts said Tuesday. Gov. Gray Davis' emphasis on buying utilities' transmission lines and negotiating long-term power contracts to help ease their debts skirts the deep imbalance between wholesale and market rates that led to the state's power problems in the first place they said. In the long run it doesn't solve anything said Michael Worms an industry analyst for Gerard Klauer Mattison & Co. In the long run you need to send the right price signals to consumers which will create its own conservation signals. Unfortunately customers were shielded from that in California. Davis said Monday that the state's first contracts to buy electricity for two financially struggling utilities will provide only about two-thirds of the power needed on a typical summer day forcing Californians to cut power use at least 10 percent to avoid blackouts. Since early January the state has been buying one- third of the power Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric Co. customers need. The two utilities denied credit by suppliers say they have lost nearly $14 billion due to soaring wholesale electricity prices that the state's industry-deregulation law says they cannot pass on to consumers. The keepers of the state power grid had enough electricity Tuesday to avoid declaring an electricity alert but have faced an almost-daily scramble for weeks due to a tight supply and high wholesale prices. Several wholesale and retail rate proposals are circulating. Among them: Free-market advocates such as Worms want an immediate end to the deregulation-imposed retail rate freeze on Edison and PG&E that will expire next year. Davis wants a Western price cap of $100 per megawatt hour on power generators he says have been prof iteering from California's short energy supply. The Bush administration and Federal Energy Regulatory Commission are cool to that idea. In December FERC imposed a soft cap of $150 per megawatt hour on wholesale rates in the state and required suppliers to justify any higher prices they charge. Consumer groups such as The Utility Reform Network or TURN want regulated rates for residential and small-business customers but free-market rates for large industrial customers which sought deregulation in the first place. TURN also advocates a tiered rate structure with higher rates for consumers who use more than a reasonable amount of electricity each month. Assembly Republicans say electricity and natural-gas prices will fall naturally if the state increases supply mainly by making it easier to build plants and pipelines. Right now you're sort of sitting partially with regulation and part with the free market said Paul Fremont an analyst with Jefferies & Co. Both these systems work. It's sort of that in-between system that you have in Califor nia that doesn't appear to be working. The system discourages generators from building new power plants because they aren't guaranteed a profit and it doesn't do enough to discourage power use by consumers because the price they pay doesn't reflect the true cost of power Fremont said. I don't think people here have much faith in the market and why should they? countered TURN's Mindy Spatt. I think there are probably better ways of encouraging consumers to conserve than by gouging them. Davis insists the crisis can be resolved without raising rates for Edison and PG&E customers beyond the existing rate structure. In January state regulators imposed temporary rate hikes of 7 to 15 percent on Edison and PG&E customers. The Legislature and Davis extended the increases for up to a decade to help pay back the estimated $10 billion in power buying the state expects to do for Edison and PG&E over the next several years and finance its purchase of the power lines owned by the two companies and San Diego Gas & Electric. Rates were already scheduled to increase next year for Edison and PG&E customers. Under the 1996 deregulation law the pair's ratepayers saw a 10 percent rate reduction but only until early 2002. That rate cut will likely expire as planned Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio has said. Davis wants those rates to cover not only the traditional cost of generating transporting and distributing power but the added cost of paying off the two utilities' massive debt and buying their transmission lines said Assemblyman Fred Keeley D-Boulder Creek the Assembly's chief power negotiator. Yet Davis has indirectly addressed the rate imbalance by signing legislation that will let regulators raise consumer rates if necessary Keeley said. The governor and lawmakers are in effect spreading out rate increases over a decade by using long-term revenue bonds to buy power for the nearly bankrupt utilities said Severin Borenstein director of the University of California Energy Institute. At some point we have to deal with the reality that all of the power that we buy has to be paid for by somebody - it's either going to come from taxpayers or it's going to come from ratepayers Bor enstein said. Raising rates now would get us a lot of conservation. Davis also wants financial incentives for conservation and power-plant construction in time to make a difference this summer. Our mouths were agape at the rapid timetable Keeley said. Legislators are rushing to pass those incentives by month's end he said allowing three months for consumers and suppliers to act before the heat of summer. Among bills considered Tuesday the Senate Energy Committee approved legislation to accelerate the siting of power plants. It also was considering a proposal to restructure rates for generators that use renewable energy to provide about 30 percent of the state's electricity. ---- Bill to Cut Some Power Prices Stalls Energy: Democrats balk at varying payment levels for alternative generators. By DAN MORAIN JULIE TAMAKI Times Staff Writers SACRAMENTO--Legislation aimed at cutting prices for more than a fourth of the power consumed in California stalled Tuesday as Democrats questioned why a few alternative energy generators--some of them campaign donors--stood to receive higher payments than others. Lawmakers working to unravel California's energy mess have been negotiating for weeks in an effort to cut the price paid to more than 600 generators of alternative power by more than half to below 8 cents a kilowatt-hour. Those alternative generators' contracts with utilities have shot up in recent months because of a rise in the price of natural gas. The cash-strapped corporations have suspended or made partial payments to the generators over the last few months causing many to shut down or reduce their outputs. But even as the lawmakers reached agreement that pushed the average price to near the 8-cent level per kilowatt-hour some generators would have received higher prices under the bill by state Sen. Jim Battin (R-La Quinta). Some of the generators that stood to benefit had donated to Battin's campaigns. One--Windtec Inc.--gave Battin a $20000 campaign donation in 1999. Others contributed from $3000 and $5000 last year. Battin acknowledged that he has received campaign contributions from some wind power generators but said there is no connection between the donations and the bill's provisions. It is illegal it is unethical and it's not how I do business he said. Battin noted that 25% of the state's alternative energy producers are in his district. As Democrats on the Senate Energy Committee blocked the bill Battin warned that some alternative energy producers might react to the delay by trying to force Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric into bankruptcy. We will be the cause of bankruptcy Battin said. That prompted Energy Committee Chairwoman Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey) to retort: I'm really tired of being threatened with bankruptcy. Alternative energy producers including those that use wind solar power biomass and other means produce 27% of the energy used in California. They sell the electricity to the utilities which in turn transmit it to retail consumers. But with the utilities facing multibillion-dollar debts the alternative energy producers under contract with Edison have not been paid since November. Scores of alternative energy producers supported the measure. Edison International and the San Francisco-based consumer group the Utility Reform Network opposed it. Michael Florio of the Utility Reform group said the deal could result in higher consumer prices an Edison representative said the same thing. Battin and Assemblyman Fred Keeley (D-Boulder Creek) worked out an arrangement with many of the generators. Keeley took the lead in the early negotiations and then turned to Battin to introduce the legislation SB 47X. Rather convoluted language would have allowed higher payments to a select few generators that produce electricity from wind and biomass. Most of California's wind suppliers for instance would have received about 6 cents per kilowatt-hour. But a handful of them about half a dozen wind farms--mostly in the Palm Springs area represented by Battin--would have received 7.8 cents. Battin contends that other wind producers receive additional payments that boost them to the same level as Windtec and others that would get the higher payments. They get the same deal Battin said of the handful of generators that would benefit from the provisions he added to the bill. In California's overall energy market the amount of money that would have flowed to the favored generators is minor. But the added prices that would have been paid to the generators would have translated to at least $19 million in the next five years to be absorbed by Southern California Edison customers according to one analysis. Also Tuesday more details were disclosed about another leg of the state's effort to escape from the energy crunch--the deals with large power generators to supply electricity to California for as long as 10 years. Those arrangements were announced by Gov. Gray Davis Monday as the bedrock of California's energy policy. But some consumer advocates warned that the deals could lock the state into excessively high-priced contracts. S. David Freeman the general manager of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and Davis' negotiator said that the state guarded against that by varying the time spans of its deals. About 6000 megawatts are expected to be available this summer about one-third of the energy needed by the state Freeman said. The amount of power under contract swells until more than 9000 megawatts are contracted in 2004 half of the needed amount before dipping to 8000 megawatts in 2010. What we're doing here is what everybody said had to be done Freeman said. We deliberately bought 50% so we'd have a good mix between long-term contracts which may turn out to be somewhat higher or somewhat lower than the spot market and purchases on the spot market. ---- PG&E could face mutiny on outages: SMUD others may balk if utility orders summer blackouts By Carrie Peyton Bee Staff Writer (Published March 7 2001) Sacramento's electric utility wants out of a deal that imposes rolling blackouts locally on PG&E's command. So do a lot of other utilities. They've been writing letters lobbying lawmakers and launching informal talks with Pacific Gas and Electric Co. to get off the hook before summer. Who dodges the blackout bullet is going to play out as a political hot button around the state said George Fraser head of the Northern California Power Agency a coalition of municipal utilities. In Sacramento the next volley is expected soon with the Sacramento Municipal Utility District reportedly poised to notify PG&E that it will no longer black out homes and businesses on the larger utility's command. We are absolutely trying to fight off the requirement for rolling blackouts for the Sacramento area said Linda Davis one of seven elected members of the SMUD board of directors. Saying they don't want to be dragged down by somebody else's problems two Southern California utilities have written grid operators asking to be exempted from any blackouts caused by PG&E's or Southern California Edison's financial woes. But in PG&E's view California is in an energy crisis (and) ... we're all in this together said spokesman John Nelson. The maneuvering comes amid bleak forecasts for power supplies this summer. Although Gov. Gray Davis has said conservation new power plants and moderate weather could avert blackouts officials at the Independent System Operator which runs much of California's grid expect frequent rotating outages. One consulting firm Cambridge Energy Research Associates predicts 20 hours of rolling blackouts during July and August and about 200 hours of especially intense calls for voluntary cutbacks. Before blackouts hit the jockeying over just whose lights air conditioners and assembly lines will be shut down is growing. The outcome could affect millions of people statewide. The state Public Utilities Commission is probing rolling blackout programs run by the for-profit utilities it regulates including PG&E and Edison. A PUC analysis has suggested that PG&E's program which currently exempts about 40 percent of its customers should spread the burden more broadly. For example it said 1.9 million homes and businesses are spared just because they share a circuit with a customer deemed essential. But not-for-profit utilities such as SMUD which answer to their own elected boards or city councils have other worries. Many have already lined up their power supplies for summer. Some have raised rates or are considering raising rates. Some have taken extra conservation steps. They think those preparations ought to give them leverage to ease blackout clauses in their contracts with PG&E. SMUD general manager Jan Schori is going to use every avenue ... any avenue to put pressure on including lobbying the ISO the governor and others said utility director Davis. The Northern California Power Agency a joint-powers authority that owns and operates power plants for municipal utilities has begun informal negotiations with PG&E to change blackout rules according to Fraser its top executive. It is preparing to write PG&E asking that its members be exempted from outages altogether. Failing that it wants them to face fewer outages or to be compensated for cutting off power he said. At SMUD the utility board has met in closed session to discuss exactly what it is required to do during electric emergencies under terms of the interconnection contract that links SMUD's lines to PG&E's. The contracts are being inspected with a fine-tooth comb said SMUD director Howard Posner. Schori declined to comment on any specifics. Sources indicated that the main option being considered is notifying PG&E that because of changed circumstances SMUD believes it no longer is required to routinely comply with outage requests. Other options being explored include re-negotiating existing agreements with PG&E. Posner said that ever since two days of rolling blackouts in January constituents have been asking him  'Why are we participating when we're not the problem?' And I don't have a good answer to that. Several directors said SMUD has already spent a lot of money -- and is considering 16 percent rate increases -- to ensure that it has enough electricity under contract to meet its customers' summer demands. They believe PG&E should do the same. We're almost like a David against Goliath here said board vice president Genevieve Shiroma. The huge investor-owned utilities next door have severe problems that they need to get under control. In addition SMUD plans to argue that because it can cut usage through its Peak Corps program which remotely turns off air conditioners at volunteer households it has already done its part without rotating outages director Davis said. PG&E believes the interconnection agreements that govern smaller utilities' ties to its transmission lines have benefits and burdens to both sides said Nelson. It wouldn't be fair or good policy for just one provision to be altered without taking a look at how that affects the entire contract he said. Interconnection contracts generally have clauses that require utilities to help each other out to avert greater emergencies. Sometimes reducing demand -- called load shedding -- can be the only way to stabilize the electric grid in the seconds after a major power plant or transmission line fails. It's been around in the electrical fabric forever said Jim Pope head of Silicon Valley Power Santa Clara's city-run utility. In addition to legal requirements you have a moral obligation so you don't bring the system to collapse. Like other city-run utilities Silicon Valley Power has a contract with PG&E that requires it to shed load during an electric emergency. But its contract allows it to work with big users to reduce their demand so no one has to be completely shut off. Such agreements formed long before deregulation when PG&E ran the north state's grid now are complicated by the 1997 creation of the state Independent System Operator. The ISO today runs pieces of the grid owned by PG&E Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric Co. If it believes power use is about to surge past supply potentially triggering a grid collapse across the western United States the ISO notifies the three utilities that they have to shed a certain number of megawatts. The big utilities meet that requirement two ways. They cut circuits to some of their own customers and they tell smaller connected utilities to cut a proportionate share. In Northern California about 80 percent of the outages are borne by PG&E customers and the rest by customers of SMUD and other municipal utilities and irrigation districts. In one sense we are all in this together. If SMUD were in danger of going down we would hope others would help us out said SMUD's Posner. But that's if we're in danger from circumstances beyond our control not from mismanagement or lack of financial wherewithal. It is unclear what penalties if any a utility would face for violating an interconnection agreement. In the long run the issue would be fought either in the courts or before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission grid officials said. As a practical matter in the seconds when the risk to the grid is greatest if one utility refused to shed load the ISO would probably solve to problem by calling on PG&E Edison or others who are willing to make deeper cutbacks they said. ---- PUC to Decide Fate Of Utility Workers PG&E Edison want to trim costs by laying off thousands cutting service Bernadette Tansey Chronicle Staff Writer Wednesday March 7 2001 2001 San Francisco Chronicle State regulators are set to decide today whether debt-ridden Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern California Edison can conserve cash by laying off thousands of workers and letting service standards slip. Union officials who protested the layoffs before the California Public Utilities Commission warn that if the cuts go through neighborhoods hit by power outages could stay dark for hours and more customers could face busy signals when they call about their bills. An administrative law judge agreed advising the commission in February to order the utilities to restore 725 positions already cut and block the elimination of an additional 2125 jobs. Judge John Wong said PG&E and Edison have acknowledged the layoffs will not substantially improve their shaky financial condition which arose from skyrocketing wholesale electricity costs the utilities could not pass on to consumers under a rate cap. The savings would barely make a dent Wong said in his draft decision. The two companies together claim that their debt from power purchases amounts to more than $13 billion. PG&E says it has saved $18 million from the first wave of 325 layoffs. Wong's recommendation is already running into resistance on the PUC. Commissioner Richard Bilas said the five-member panel should not be micromanaging the utilities in a time of crisis. Bilas has proposed an alternate ruling that would allow the utilities to make the cuts but provide for PUC monitoring of service in case the commission wants to step in later. We're in a situation where the utilities are not collecting the revenues they need to operate and yet we may be guilty of not letting them cut expenses where they can cut expenses Bilas said. PG&E spokesman Jon Tremayne said savings from the layoffs are helping to keep electricity running and gas flowing. It keeps cash in our accounts so we can keep doing day-to-day business Tremayne said. In addition to the 325 positions dropped so far PG&E is proposing to cut an additional 675 during the next three to six months. The cuts affect temporary and contract workers who read meters handle new service hookups and replace equipment. PG&E has no plans to eliminate permanent positions. The company is struggling to keep up with a higher workload at its call center as customers deluge the lines with inquiries about their rising bills and the effects of deregulation. Calls to PG&E ballooned from 1.3 million in January 2000 to 2.3 million in January 2001. Bilas advocates granting PG&E's request to temporarily relax standards requiring the utility to respond swiftly to customer calls and to read customers' meters once a month. PG&E wants to read meters bimonthly and send bills based on the estimated use between readings. Discrepancies could be corrected later. Wong called those measures unacceptable. He said customers need to know immediately if their efforts to conserve power are working. Wong also said the utilities' own experts have said the workforce reductions will lengthen the time required to restore power after nonemergency equipment failure. Eric Wolfe communications director for the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 1245 said some customers have already been left without power overnight because PG&E is trying to avoid the use of overtime on nonemergency power outages. It hurts a lineman to walk away from the job leaving a customer without power Wolfe said. Tremayne said PG&E is trying to minimize overtime costs but denied the company has allowed customers to go without power out of financial concerns. He said crews were pulled out when darkness and falling trees made the work too dangerous. ---- Power prices could soar during the summer Posted at 10:35 p.m. PST Tuesday March 6 2001 BY STEVE JOHNSON Mercury News Unless Gov. Gray Davis arranges significantly more long-term electricity contracts or persuades people to turn off a lot more lights California's unpredictable spot market for power could wreak havoc this summer. Even with the 40 long-term deals announced by Davis on Monday experts interviewed Tuesday said up to 43 percent of the state's daily needs may have to come from this highly volatile market in which power is bought within a day of need. That could could prove hugely expensive because some spot market energy has cost five to six times what it would under the long-term contracts. It's widely expected that consumers ultimately would have to pay that tab which could amount to billions of dollars. And because that power won't be locked up in contracts there is no guarantee it will be available when it's needed which could lead to blackouts according to a recent report to the California Independent System Operator which oversees three-fourths of the state's power grid. ``The situation in California could reach catastrophic proportions'' the report concluded adding that unless things change dramatically ``it is a virtual certainty that peak demand will go unmet during many hot summer days.'' Steven Maviglio Davis' press secretary conceded Tuesday that the spot market could be troublesome. ``It's a major concern'' he said which is why the state is trying to line up more power contracts speed up power plant construction and promote conservation. During the normally hot month of August peak daily demand for power in the Independent System Operator's territory is expected to hit about 47700 megawatts -- enough for nearly 48 million homes. The state's three main utility firms generate about 8200 megawatts and have long-term contracts from wind solar and other energy sources for about 11700 megawatts more. That totals about 20000 megawatts. Add in the 7000 megawatts of long-term power that Davis has announced for this summer and the state is still nearly 21000 megawatts short. Costly proposition If all that power has to be obtained on the spot market the price could be high. On Friday last-minute purchases on the market averaged $411 per megawatt-hour compared to about $150 per megawatt-hour for all power obtained by the Independent System Operator and $69 per megawatt-hour on average under Davis' long-term contracts. It's possible that not all 21000 megawatts would have to be purchased on the market. Assuming Davis is successful in getting people to save 10 percent -- which could prove difficult -- conservation could reduce peak demand by nearly 5000 megawatts. California also might be able to trade for another 5000 megawatts with the federal government's Bonneville Power Administration and a hydroelectric operator in British Columbia said Arthur O'Donnell editor of California Energy Markets a trade publication. Under such deals those two outfits often send that much power to California when they don't need it and California returns the same amount or more when its demand is low. But O'Donnell said it wasn't clear whether 5000 megawatts would be available this summer because ``they still haven't gotten the snowpack they need in the Pacific Northwest'' which could limit that region's generating capacity. Still falling short Even if those hydropower imports are available and conservation works as Davis hopes it's likely California would still require the spot market for 11000 megawatts to meet the August demand. That's more than 20 percent of the state's overall power needs. ``All of the surrounding states are buying probably less than 5 percent at most of their energy on the spot market'' said Frank Wolak a Stanford economist who monitors electricity prices for the Independent System Operator. He worries about how much that power could cost and is disturbed that state officials haven't adequately addressed the issue. ``No one has any idea what they are going to do and that is part of the problem'' he said. Officials at Pacific Gas & Electric Co. are particularly concerned. They fear that their company -- which is nearing bankruptcy -- could get stuck for much of the spot market purchases by the Independent System Operator which has threatened to bill the utilities for the cost. Fearing the annual bill for that power could hit $2.4 billion this year PG&E wants the tab sent to the Department of Water Resources which also is buying power on the spot market for the state. But the Department of Water Resources has objected to that idea and the matter is expected to be heard today by the California Public Utilities Commission. ``We're looking for clarity on a number of issues'' regarding how the spot market will work ``and certainly that's one of them'' said Thomas Hannigan the water agency's director. ``I don't think anybody knows the answer of who's going to pay for it'' added PG&E spokesman John Nelson. But Nettie Hoge executive director of the Utility Reform Network in San Francisco said she suspects consumers ultimately will foot the bill. The unfortunate likelihood about spot market purchases is that ``ratepayers are responsible for all of it eventually'' Hoge said. ``It's a very big problem.'' ---- Power Plant Plans Cause Conflicts East county residents blast supervisors Jason B. Johnson Chronicle Staff Writer Wednesday March 7 2001 Industry dreams of building new power plants in east Contra Costa's hills are prompting an angry reaction among residents and elected officials who say they don't want more plants. The conflict was sparked by a vote by county supervisors yesterday to aggressively explore possible sites for new power plants throughout the county. The measure by Supervisors Mark DeSaulnier and Federal Glover which passed on a 4-to-0 vote directs the county administrator and Department of Community Development to compile a report on possible sites within 45 days. Supervisor Donna Gerber abstained after criticizing the plan for potentially repeating the same mistakes that plagued the state's energy deregulation effort by not considering how much energy the state region and county will need in future years and how much power is slated to come online. Gerber said alternative power sources such as solar should also be examined. A site drawing much attention is on top of a deposit of natural gas near the Concord Naval Weapons Station off Highway 4. The owners of 70 acres of land near the station recently formed a company Golden State Power Co. to pursue construction of at least one small peaker plant and a much larger facility capable of producing 600 megawatts. The site could hold up to three small 50-megawatt peaker plants and a larger 15-acre natural gas plant said Steve Thomas managing partner with Golden State. No land use applications have been filed. Thomas said 30 acres could be kept as open space to form a buffer around the project. Both (facilities) are state of the art said Thomas. We believe that the site is ideal. But east county residents at yesterday's meeting blasted the supervisorial measure and the power plant proposal complaining that more plants could put people's health at risk. The region already is home to six power plants. We're going to get a good dose of poor air quality and (negative) health conditions from this said Concord resident Evelyn Frietas. I think we need to stop and think about what we're doing to our quality of life. Dan Torres said the home he bought in 1995 at a new Bay Point development would be alarmingly close to the proposed Golden State site. It will be dragging emissions over our home said Torres. I didn't buy a home on that hill to be surrounded by power plants. There are six power plants in operation in east Contra Costa. Pittsburg already has two power plants and two more under construction. City Council members Frank Aiello and Yvonne Beals said the Antioch-Pittsburg area has done more than its share of energy production. Aiello said Pittsburg will soon produce enough energy to power three million homes in California. When is enough enough? asked Aiello. Pittsburg has shouldered responsibility for a land-fill and two more power plants. At some point you have to say enough. Beals said that while power plants have added millions to the city's general fund the negatives of additional plants could outweigh the benefits. I don't think that Pittsburg or east county should be the dumping ground for energy for California said Beals. ---- Supervisors set search for power plant sites The board also heard from the potential developers of a 650-megawatt plant between Bay Point and Concord By Thomas Peele TIMES STAFF WRITER MARTINEZ -- Contra Costa County supervisors took tentative steps Tuesday toward allowing the construction of at least one small power plant before summer ordering that its staff identify potential sites in unincorporated areas within seven weeks. The board voted 4-0 to search for locations. Third District Supervisor Donna Gerber abstained saying her colleagues lacked a comprehensive context'' to identify sites. I think the board knows just enough to be dangerous'' she said. Gerber said the county should examine the potential for additional power plants within its borders but not investigate individual sites yet. But Fourth District Supervisor Mark DeSaulnier said the action was necessary because of the energy crisis and because of Gov. Gray Davis' call for local governments to help speed the construction of so-called peaker plants before July and August. I wouldn't do this except under an emergency DeSaulnier said after the vote. There are unusual circumstances. We're not talking about putting this in a residential area. Fifth District Supervisor Federal Glover backed DeSaulnier but said he hoped for a location outside his heavily industrialized East County district. There's a lot of concern in East County as to the number of plants he said. DeSaulnier said though that the only logical place for a small plant remains the industrial belt'' stretching along the waterfront from West County to Antioch. He declined to provide specifics but said the only other potential site outside the industrial areas was the Concord Naval Weapons Station property. But he quickly added that he believes the U.S. Department of Defense would never go for it. Also DeSaulnier said he could not rule out the county building the plant itself and entering the electricity-selling market during peak demand times. Board Chairwoman Gayle Uilkema called that idea extremely premature and unlikely. That's a very powerful decision. I do not think we are ready'' she said. The California Energy Commission listed the Equilon refinery in Martinez as one of 32 potential peaker plant sites in the state last week. Peaker plants kick in during peak usage times. Davis called for their quick construction before the height of summer and its energy demand for air conditioning. Plants that generate as much as 50000 megawatts don't need Energy Commission approval. DeSaulnier said he believed a peaker plant could be built about a month after final approval. Supervisors also heard from the potential developers of a 650-megawatt plant between Bay Point and Concord. Walnut Creek commercial real estate developer Steve Thomas announced his intentions for the site north of Highway 4 last week. Construction could take two years. Eric Hasseltine a consultant representing Thomas and what he described as a brand new company for the site the Golden State Power Co. told supervisors that if they intended to speed peaker plant construction they should do what they can to expedite the larger plant. The Thomas site could house a peaker plant until the proposed larger one goes online. A large natural gas line passes under the site. DeSaulnier seemed cautious about the larger proposal which he had described last week as a good site. Uilkema too said she knew too little about it to comment. A resident who lives near the Thomas property asked the board to build it (the larger plant) closer to where you have industrial areas. You have to carefully consider the people who live nearby said Dan Torres 39. Evelyn Freitas of Concord said she lives downwind of the proposed site. Our air quality is going to be worse then it is now she said. Gerber played on the environmental issues saying the county already ranks second statewide to Los Angeles in volume of hazardous materials and amount of electrical generation. ---- Peter Schrag: California's $90 billion infrastructure gap (Published March 7 2001) By now California's surreal energy mess has grown from a crisis to a condition. It may not be quite as permanent as say death and taxes but it's still something that could get a whole lot worse before it gets better. Until there's more realistic pricing no gubernatorial pea-under-the-shell buyout scheme will solve it. Beyond the energy crisis however and in many ways similar to it California faces a whole range of other infrastructure problems -- in transportation in water resources and sewer systems in school and university buildings -- that seem once again to be all but forgotten. The Business Roundtable has estimated the need at roughly $90 billion though no number can possibly be exact. What's certain is that after a burst of high-level investment in public facilities during the 1950s and 1960s California's annual capital investment has sunk precipitously -- from an annual $150 per capita in the 1960s according to a set of recent studies for PPIC the Public Policy Institute of California to about $30 in the 1990s. But you probably don't need to tell anyone driving Bay Area or Los Angeles freeways or looking at the ubiquitous portable classrooms those dreary brown boxes that house a fourth of our public school students. Ever since passage of Proposition 13 in 1978 we have been flying the flag of deferred maintenance. As in the state's electricity crisis however there's no way California can effectively address those problems merely by building or bonding itself out of them. In highway construction in developing water resources in finding enough university space to accommodate the Tidal Wave II of students managing demand is likely to be as crucial to any solution as new construction. In the energy market -- and in electricity particularly -- it's been a familiar principle ever since David Roe of the Environmental Defense Fund first persuaded Pacific Gas and Electric that a dollar invested in conservation may be worth as much as the same investment in new generation. But in most other sectors of California's infrastructure state and local it's a lesson still to be learned. There have been scattered attempts to encourage conservation and reduce demand -- significant reduction in water use for example through the installation of low-flow faucets and low-flush toilets some reduction in traffic by using rush-hour diamond lanes or by adjusting highway or (as in New York) bridge tolls to levels of congestion. But as pointed out by David Dowall an urban economist at Berkeley state policy-makers have not really begun to consider how demand management strategies can be applied to infrastructure service areas or how the more efficient use of facilities and more realistic pricing -- highway tolls say or parking fees -- can reduce demand for scarce infrastructure resources. In any case says Dowall in one of the PPIC reports we should pick which major projects we will build not just according to per capita estimates of how much we need but according to how much consumers are willing to pay for them. To avoid hurting the poor congestion-related highway tolls and other tariffs can be rebated on the basis of income. University fees can be means-tested. In California they also could be adjusted to encourage summer school classes and other off-peak uses rather than (as in the past) making UC summer courses more expensive. Given the political and economic uncertainties there's no way to know how far such demand management can be taken. But there's not much doubt that as Dowall and others point out the state's infrastructure planning is a jumble of uncoordinated agency agendas and wish lists. The Legislature last year passed a bill AB 1473 by Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg that requires the governor beginning next year to submit an annual five-year infrastructure plan for state agencies and public schools along with recommendations on how to fund it. In addition Gov. Gray Davis' infrastructure commission is expected to recommend better coordination of infrastructure and land-use planning when it issues its report this spring. That would be a start. As California State Treasurer Phil Angelides has pointed out the state desperately needs to start joint planning -- regional planning -- for housing roads and other resources to reduce the need for long commutes to preserve open space and to bring jobs to where people live and housing to where the jobs are. That would itself reduce demand for more freeway lanes and equally important improve the quality of life. At present most planning for housing roads water systems and other facilities rarely recognizes the regional impact of local decisions. In the East Bay slow-growth forces push well-intended initiatives that would force more development into Tracy or Modesto and further tax the transportation systems to Silicon Valley. In city after city there are beggar-thy-neighbor efforts to grab yet another shopping mall that produces a little extra sales tax revenue for the city that gets it and that often compounds traffic and revenue problems in adjacent communities. In higher education we divide bond proceeds evenly among UC the California State University and the community colleges even though the community colleges serve eight times as many students as UC. We plan road projects according to county not regional priorities. It is all done according to antiquated political and fiscal formulas that often no longer make sense. We don't just need better capital planning we need a whole new planning system. ---- PG&E power plan debated at hearing A PUC meeting on the utility's capacity expansion project for the Tri-Valley follows weeks of protest from officials residents Power upgrade in valley debated By Megan Long TIMES STAFF WRITER SAN FRANCISCO -- Dublin officials and the developer of a Livermore subdivision faced questions Tuesday about their opposition to alternative routes of PG&E's controversial Tri-Valley power upgrade plan -- and answered by restating their long-standing objections. Tuesday's cross-examination came during the third and likely final week of the California Public Utility Commission's evidentiary hearings on the utility's $91 million Tri-Valley 2002 Capacity Increase Project. It has followed weeks of protests of PG&E's upgrade plans by officials and residents of Livermore Pleasanton Dublin and San Ramon. And before the questioning started Dublin Vice Mayor Janet Lockhart reiterated concerns about an alternative route deemed environmentally superior that would place a substation just 1000 feet north of Interstate 580 between Tassajara and Fallon roads. She said that would undermine the results of a 15-year process to plan the eastern development of the city. It's extremely important to the residents of our community to follow a plan we worked hard to produce she said. Dublin officials favor PG&E's proposed placement of the station three miles north of the freeway away from new high-tech company offices and housing developments. Besides the Dublin substation the project calls for construction of a substation in North Livermore expansion of the Pleasanton substation and installation of 23.5 miles of new lines. In response to questions from PUC Administrative Law Judge Michelle Cooke Dublin's public works director Lee Thompson confirmed that the Lin family the owner of the property where the alternative substation would go wasn't interested in selling the land to PG&E. Cooke also asked Thompson to define a discretionary permit which is how city officials said they might treat a permit for a substation. Lee said that type of permit is one the city has the right to approve or not depending on the project's impact. Eddie Peabody Dublin's community development director testified that the zoning for the Lin property accommodates uses such as commercial business research and development and light manufacturing. It would not he said be appropriate for a power substation. He said parcels within the East Dublin area that could host a station would include those zoned for public and semi-public uses including land recently bought by Oracle and Sun Microsystems for new campuses. While Dublin officials testified that one buyer of land in that area paid $86 per square foot others suggested land prices would be inflated to help make a PG&E land buy look prohibitively expensive. An executive of Centex Homes the developer of new houses near Isabel Avenue and Concannon Boulevard objected to an alternative route that would place high-voltage transmission lines overhead along Isabel and Stanley Boulevard. David Barclay president of Centex's Northern California division said that the 80-foot to 150-foot towers would have a severe visual impact on residents of the Prima tract. Ed O'Neill a lawyer for the Kottinger Ranch Homeowners Association pointed out that existing distribution lines on 50-foot poles on Isabel already mar the view for residents. The Foley family has been ranching on land south of Pleasanton city limits for years said their attorney Kennedy Richardson. The utility's project would place overhead lines and a transmission station on rolling hills that the family envisions as one day being public open space with limited development Richardson said. Lawyers for Pleasanton Livermore Kottinger Ranch and Centex are scheduled to cross-examine a PG&E engineer today about the project's routing. That testimony should be the most controversial of the hearings. Judge Cooke is expected to recommend an alignment by July to the PUC which will make the final decision. ---- NEWS State OKs 'Peaker' Power Plant at SFO / Temporary generator could be sending electricity to 50000 homes by August Marshall Wilson 03/08/2001 The San Francisco Chronicle FINAL Page A.20 (Copyright 2001) State energy officials yesterday approved plans to build a temporary electrical plant at San Francisco International Airport that should generate enough juice to power 50000 homes by August. Meeting in Sacramento the Energy Commission voted 4-0 to give the green light to the gas-fired plant. It will operate during peak summer and winter demand to help the state avoid Stage 3 power alerts and rolling blackouts. Texas-based El Paso Merchant Energy Co. won approval under a new state law mandating speedy four-month reviews of so-called peaker plants. It was the only one of seven applications statewide to win approval. The other proposals were withdrawn for various reasons. The 51-megawatt plant formally called the United Golden Gate Power Project is scheduled to be built at the northwest corner of the airport near the United Airlines maintenance center. Within the next few weeks El Paso plans to apply to build a 571- megawatt $400 million plant in the same area company spokesman Jesse Frederick said. It would undergo a separate review by state energy officials. The small peaker plant approved yesterday is to generate electricity beginning around Aug. 1 for up to three years. After the end of three years the plant would be closed or converted to a cleaner-burning system. Under state law a temporary peaker plant is permitted to spew more air pollution than a permanent plant. El Paso's temporary plant is to be built next to a co-generation plant operated by United Airlines. It would use existing connections for natural gas and water supplies and tap into existing power transmission lines. Electricity generated by the plant would be pumped into the state's electrical grid Energy Commission spokesman Gary Fay said. It would also serve as a backup for San Francisco Airport in case of a blackout. No one spoke against the proposed plant at yesterday's commission meeting. The proposal however has been criticized by area residents and environmentalists worried about air pollution. Scott Buschman a professional photographer and San Bruno resident said yesterday it was unjust that state officials 100 miles away in Sacramento approved a Texas company's proposal to put a power plant on land owned by San Francisco. The fact that they approved it without considering the public's concerns foremost air quality is very disturbing he said. Fay said the plant complies with clean-air standards. Answering the criticism about the location of yesterday's deliberation he said three hearings and several workshops were held in communities near the airport. Copyright  2000 Dow Jones & Company Inc. All Rights Reserved. ---- Crossed Wires: Major Kinks Emerge In Gov. Davis's Plan To Power California --- State's Outlays for Electricity May Be Hard to Recover Without Rate Increases --- Betting on Long-Term Deals By Wall Street Journal staff reporters Rebecca Smith Mitchel Benson and John R. Emshwiller 03/08/2001 The Wall Street Journal A1 (Copyright (c) 2001 Dow Jones & Company Inc.) SACRAMENTO Calif. -- Earlier this year Gov. Gray Davis made what may be the biggest bet in the history of the nation's biggest state: that he could tame an out-of-control electricity market and avoid devastating blackouts without busting the state's budget antagonizing its consumers or derailing his own political career. His wager is still on the table but the assumptions that underlie it are looking increasingly shaky these days. The governor has already spent around $2 billion of public money buying hugely expensive wholesale power taking over the role formerly played by the state's near-bankrupt electric utilities. And California will probably be obliged to spend billions more before its electricity market stabilizes and those utilities are restored to some semblance of financial health. Under the governor's plan California aims to recoup the money it is using to buy electricity by issuing $10 billion in bonds. That way it would still have a healthy budget surplus to finance new spending on roads schools and other public services. But there's a potentially big obstacle to this plan. The state Legislature worried about racking up billions in new debt has put limits on the size of any bond offering. In broad terms the Legislature's action would allow the state to borrow only four times as much as it can recover annually from utility customers. Right now that doesn't appear to be much. Under the current rate structure essentially set in place by California's flawed 1996 electricity-deregulation plan consumers pay far less for power than the cost of acquiring it on the wholesale market. Preliminary estimates submitted by utilities last month to the California Public Utilities Commission show the state's share of the proceeds from electricity sales this year could be as little as $241 million -- not enough to support even $1 billion in bond sales under the Legislature's formula. That would leave the state on the hook for much of the money it has already paid for power -- not to mention the billions more Gov. Davis will need to spend. That in turn raises the prospect that California's economy and its credit rating both could deteriorate significantly. But state finance officials say that based on their own projections they will be able to extract enough money to support a $10 billion bond issue. Walking a careful line between fiscal prudence and political survival Mr. Davis and others in his administration are scrambling to come up with ways to get around the legislative restrictions without raising rates for consumers. If I wanted to raise rates I could solve this problem in 20 minutes Mr. Davis says. The governor says he believes that the state can obtain enough affordable power through long-term power-supply contracts to avoid the need for a big rate increase. The billions of dollars the state hopes to borrow would be used to help pay for power until electricity prices drop as they are expected to do when new power plants come online over the next few years. The Davis administration fears that what may be its only other option -- a big increase in retail electric rates -- could prompt angry consumer groups to seek new electricity laws through a statewide ballot initiative during next year's election. That's when Mr. Davis is expected to run for a second term as governor. But trying to save California without rate increases is forcing Mr. Davis to make some colossal gambles with the state's money. State officials estimate that in the next several months California will need to spend as much as $6 billion on power purchases -- equivalent to the state's entire fiscal surplus. Mr. Davis is also looking to spend several billion more to buy the transmission assets of three investor-owned utilities in order to restore two of them to credit-worthiness. He also has announced plans to spend several hundred million dollars more on conservation programs designed to reduce demand while new power plants are being built in the state. In order to limit the state's financial exposure in the meantime the governor and his aides have in some cases ignored state law. They have threatened appointed officials who have stood in the way. And they have sharply restricted the flow of information to the public. None of those steps is expected to do much to reduce state spending on power in the coming months. In a few weeks power usage is expected to begin a sharp seasonal rise as Californians switch on their air conditioners with the coming of warmer weather. By various estimates demand during peak periods this summer could outstrip supply by 10% or several thousand megawatts. That could produce more rolling blackouts like the ones that hit Northern California earlier this year. It is also likely to put strong upward pressure on wholesale electricity prices. Steven Zimmerman managing director of Standard & Poor's Corp. says Mr. Davis and his aides don't have a lot of time to put a cap on the state's financial exposure to the crisis. The credit-rating agency has put the state on credit watch for a possible downgrade which would affect the value of all of California's outstanding public debt. Moody's Investor Service Inc. is also concerned. It said in a recent report that the power crisis could soon seriously threaten the health of the state's economy. Mr. Davis a Democrat and career politician was dealt a bad hand when he took office in 1999. The deregulation plan that sparked the state's electricity crisis was enacted under his predecessor Republican Pete Wilson. But Mr. Davis was slow to react to early signs of trouble this past summer and alarms sounded by members of the state Legislature. By the time Mr. Davis finally sprang into action earlier this year a troublesome power-supply squeeze had escalated into a crisis. In a Jan. 17 declaration of emergency the governor designated the state Department of Water Resources to take the utilities' place as the daily buyer of huge quantities of electricity. His hope: that by making the state the dominant player in California's power sector he would ease electricity producers' concerns about getting paid and give the state enough clout to negotiate lower long-term power prices. Earlier this week Mr. Davis announced final or tentative agreements with 20 power suppliers to furnish the state with a total of 8900 megawatts for periods of as long as 20 years. But the supply situation remains extremely uncertain for this summer when demand probably will top 45000 megawatts. If the state can secure enough power under contract and push down demand through aggressive conservation it might be able to squeak through the summer season. If not it will be forced to keep buying huge amounts of costly power in the cash market. Under deregulation retail electric rates were frozen for several years while wholesale-power costs were free to fluctuate. When the plan was conceived wholesale prices were low and expected to go lower. However a combination of unexpected growth in power demand and a lack of new generating capacity helped produce a supply squeeze. Average wholesale prices more than tripled last year from 1999. And in January those prices were up 10-fold from a year earlier. By then California's two biggest investor-owned utilities -- the Pacific Gas & Electric unit of PG&E Corp. and the Southern California Edison subsidiary of Edison International -- faced imminent financial collapse. They had racked up billions of dollars in wholesale power bills they couldn't afford to pay. As generators began shying away from selling to the two utilities the Clinton administration forced them to sell power into the California market an order left in place during the first weeks of the Bush administration. Still northern California was hit by rolling blackouts on several days in early January. Since then the DWR which does some electricity trading as an adjunct to its main mission of managing the state's giant system of aqueducts and reservoirs has had to learn the ins and outs of power markets on the run. It hasn't been easy. David Mills trading-floor manager for the federal Bonneville Power Administration says the water agency has at times offered to pay $50 to $100 per megawatt hour more than the available market price. They agree to prices that make you wonder says Mr. Mills whose organization markets electricity from federal dams in the Pacific Northwest. You'd at least think they'd check to see what the prevailing price is before throwing out their offer. Mr. Mills says that to cut California some slack he occasionally has instructed his traders to sell at prices lower than the DWR had offered to pay. Ray Hart the water agency deputy director responsible for the power purchasing says he isn't aware of any cases in which the DWR has overpaid. He says his team has been extremely successful by all measures. Ultimately the DWR's trading acumen is far less important than the overall arithmetic of power supply and demand in California. With the price of natural gas that feeds many of the region's generating plants at near record levels and some suppliers reluctant to sell into the troubled California market wholesale electric prices remain stubbornly high and in recent days have again been rising. The Legislature has advanced the DWR about $3 billion from the state's general fund for power purchases. Under emergency legislation passed by the Legislature and signed by Mr. Davis on Feb. 1 the general fund is to be reimbursed from a planned bond sale later this year. But under terms of the emergency law the water agency would have to wrest $2.5 billion a year in revenue from retail electricity rates in order to sell the $10 billion worth of bonds sought by Mr. Davis. Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg a Southern California Democrat says the formula was created to ensure that there would be a way to repay the bonds without draining the state's coffers. We didn't want to just open our wallets he says. According to the language of the Feb. 1 law the water agency gets what's left of revenue collected from ratepayers after the utilities pay certain of their own power-supply bills and other expenses. And in their filings with the PUC last month the utilities reckoned under their worst-case scenarios that there would be only $241 million available to the DWR this year. State officials are quietly pushing the PUC to rejigger the formula so that the water department gets more money -- even though that would clash with terms of the Feb. 1 law. Robert Miyashiro deputy director of the Department of Finance says the emergency law was drafted poorly and has led people to believe the DWR only gets the leftover money. He predicts there will be cleanup legislation. At the request of the Davis administration the PUC is considering a plan to use a different revenue-sharing formula than the one in the state law. The proposed new formula was written in close consultation with Mr. Davis's Finance Department says PUC President Loretta Lynch who supports the initiative and is hoping to rush it through. The effort has drawn some opposition. Commissioner Richard Bilas at a recent PUC meeting questioned the legality of the commission attempting to change a formula set by the Legislature. PG&E is even more emphatic since the DWR's extra money could come at the utility's expense. The formula threatens to undo the very financial protections for the utilities that [the new law] attempted to provide the utility said in a recent filing with the PUC. As politicians and regulators wrestle with that issue the Davis administration has taken a step to reduce the outflow of state cash that also seems to conflict with the Feb. 1 law. It was widely assumed that the law required the DWR to buy any electricity the state needed to keep its lights on. However on many occasions the DWR has refused to buy power on the grounds that it was too expensive citing a portion of the new law that urges the agency to hold down costs. The task of covering any remaining shortfall has passed to the California Independent System Operator which manages the state's energy grid and is charged with buying power when necessary to avert shortages. However the ISO doesn't have any power-purchasing money of its own and the major parties it would normally bill are PG&E and Edison whose inability to pay their power bills was the reason the state started buying electricity in the first place. Amid criticism of its stance from generators utilities and Wall Street the DWR says it has started covering more of the utilities' electricity costs. The water agency is now buying 95% to 99% of what California needs in a given day says the agency's Mr. Hart. But increased buying only adds to the uncertainty about the eventual tab. The state's legislative analyst Elizabeth Hill recently recommended that lawmakers hold off considering more than $2 billion in state spending on items ranging from college construction to beach cleanups because of continuing questions about the financial impact of the electricity crisis. Like others Ms. Hill complains that the governor's office and state agencies haven't been forthcoming with information. Indeed the DWR refuses to say precisely how much power it is purchasing and at what prices though it has on several occasions gone back to the Legislature for more money. State officials say that data on its purchasing activities would give suppliers an advantage in continuing electricity-supply contract talks. State Controller Kathleen Connell who is running for mayor of Los Angeles in an April election recently announced plans to post state power-spending information on her department's Web site. But within 24 hours Ms. Connell suspended that plan after discussions with senior Davis administration officials. I feel very strongly that this information should be publicly released says Ms. Connell. I just don't want to do anything that would weaken the state's effectiveness in negotiating. In an effort to more tightly control events the governor obtained legislative approval to abolish the 26-member ISO board which was made up of everyone from utility executives to representatives of consumer groups. He then appointed a new five-member board. To ensure a quick transition the California attorney general threatened the old board members with fines of as much as $5000 each if they didn't immediately relinquish their positions. All did. I was offended at the heavy-handed treatment says Karen Johanson a former ISO board member. One of the first acts of the ISO's new board was to close a meeting about the electricity crisis. The former ISO board routinely held such meetings in public. ISO attorneys say the meeting was largely designed as a private briefing for new board members and that the organization is committed to keeping its deliberations as open as possible. The Wall Street Journal and other news organizations have unsuccessfully challenged the closure in Sacramento state court. Copyright  2000 Dow Jones & Company Inc.

Mark does not appear to concur with me. Perhaps I should go ahead and express our interest to testify and then we can have a conversation with the team to decide who should do it.

134,Re: Funky Business,I have looked it over. I think they would do a good job. Another idea: Dick Foster (advisor to Enron's Board and Senior Director at McKinsey) has a great book out: Creative Destruction. I was on a panel with him recently where he shared some of his research. He is a very good presenter he knows Enron well and his work is first rate. He might be a good addition. I have an idea on the breakout sessions. It needs some work but I'd like to talk it through with you. TERRIE JAMES@ENRON COMMUNICATIONS 07/05/2001 01:09 PM To: Steven J Kean/NA/Enron@Enron cc: Subject: Funky Business Steve Have you had a chance to look at the book Funky Business and to give any thought to having Jonas present at the Management Conference? I know you have a thousand other things on your plate not the least of which is California so I understand if the answer is no. However they've been contacted by someone else about the date so we may be forced to decide rather soon. On a related subject I'm contemplating another topic for the conference. I'd seen an article in Fortune several months ago titled Managing for the Slowdown. It talked about new challenges managers face in light of the economic downturn. (Most young managers have never experienced anything but boom times.) The article also outlines a dozen or so things companies should be thinking about now. (Use the downturn as a new opportunity to evaluate people. Overhaul your budget process. Don't stop communicating. etc.) I think it would be beneficial to address similar strategies and ideas with our managers. I'd love to get your thoughts on this idea.

By MICHAEL LIEDTKE AP Business Writer 05/03/2001 Associated Press Newswires Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - There's a limit to how much people will pay for most things in life. If the cost scares off enough buyers prices eventually fall. So what would happen if this textbook example from Economics 101 were applied to California's electricity crisis? What if the state officials struggling to maintain energy supplies simply refused to buy power above a certain price and accepted more blackouts this summer? The question would have been absurd just a few months ago and even now the notion seems surreal given the possible consequences. Inviting even more blackouts inevitably would hurt businesses and frustrate consumers threatening to further depress California's already slumping economy - the sixth largest in the world. But desperate times require drastic measures according to the economists lawmakers and activists who believe the state will be better off sitting in the dark than buying electricity at any price during a summer shortage likely to produce recurring blackouts anyway. It's better to use (blackouts) and break the (wholesale energy) cartel than simply to suffer them said Michael Shames executive director of the Utility Consumer Action Network a San Diego watchdog group. Refusing to buy enough power to keep the lights on would be like playing with fire counters Wells Fargo & Co. chief economist Sung Won Sohn. Blackouts aren't a just matter of inconvenience or being too hot or cold. They cost businesses a lot of money. Buying electricity at the last minute to meet the state's power needs already has cost the California government $5.7 billion in the past 3 1/2 months. The state energy bill for 2001 could reach $50 billion in money otherwise spent on education public safety and health care Shames said. Faced with the prospect of a significant budget deficit some lawmakers think it's time for California to take a stand against the power wholesalers - many of whom are based outside the state. This Tuesday the state Senate Energy Committee will consider authorizing the state to refuse to buy power above certain prices. Current law requires state electricity managers to avoid blackouts by buying all available power at any cost. We have been over a barrel in so many ways said Sen. Dede Alpert D-Coronado who sponsored SB73x. Maybe there's a point in the market where (we) just say no and go with the planned blackout strategy instead. Economists give the bill little chance of succeeding. It's never going to happen. It's not a viable option said University of California at Berkeley Professor Severin Borenstein one of the energy experts who have studied the idea. The business lost during blackouts would mean more layoffs in a state already skittish over the technology downturn and the looming Hollywood writers strike economists say. Other ripple effects include diminished gasoline supplies leading to even higher prices at the pump and distribution headaches that could leave store shelves bare. And some consumers - the elderly and the infirm for example need power at any price. Without electricity Manteca resident Betty Jarzemkoski said she wouldn't be able to help her ailing husband to get out of his motorized bed at home. It would be a real hardship for us said Jarzemkoski 78. I'm on a fixed income so I hope they can figure out something to bring down prices. But we need power. Despite such concerns the concept of a buyer's boycott hasn't been flatly ruled out - at least publicly - by Gov. Gray Davis as he struggles to reduce the state's staggering electricity bill. The state is spending as much as $90 million per day to meet California's electricity needs and the bleeding is sure to get worse. When the summer heat increases demand and tightens supplies California might spend more than $1 billion each week state officials estimate. Extended blackouts pose an even greater cost economists say. When Northern California suffered rolling blackouts for several hours Jan. 18-19 the economic losses totaled $2.3 billion mostly from lost profits and wages estimated the Los Angeles Economic Development Corp. Multiply that over several weeks across the entire state and it becomes apparent why it makes more sense for California to continue buying power at inflated prices even if leaves the state with deep debts and a ruined credit rating economists argue. As it is California probably won't be able to round up enough power at any price on some days this summer making some blackouts a virtual certainty. The blackouts will reduce the state's economic output by $2 billion to $16 billion according to a study released last month by the Bay Area Economic Forum. The resolve of the state's politicians and ratepayers would be sorely tested for a boycott to succeed much in the way that labor strikes boil down to whether workers or management can withstand more financial pain. Politicians aren't going to willingly turn out the lights because politicians want to get re-elected said Borenstein director of the University of California's energy institute. As soon as people start losing their jobs because the power is off the public will get tired of the blackouts real quick. Still Californians might tolerate an increase in blackouts if they understand why the state chose to pursue such a drastic course said Stanford economics Professor Frank Wolak who heads the Independent System Operator's market surveillance committee. This isn't something you could do without an enormous public relations campaign he said. The campaign would have to explain that the state had no other choice but to do this because (federal power regulators) aren't doing their job and enforcing the law against unjust and unreasonable prices. The largest out-of-state generators are in such robust financial shape that it might take weeks before they would feel such pain from a California boycott that they would be forced to lower prices.

BOMBAY May 3 (Reuters) - Indian lenders to U.S. energy group Enron Corp's gas-fired power plant south of Bombay have appealed to the Indian government to help end the company's row with a state-owned electricity board over pricing and upaid bills. The board of Enron's Indian unit Dabhol Power Co (DPC) has authorised management to stop selling power to the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) if a bitter dispute over pricing and unpaid bills cannot be resolved. In the past half year the MSEB has defaulted on bills for electricity supplied by Dabhol which operates the world's largest gas-fired plant on the west coast of India 160 kilometres (100 miles) south of Bombay. Indian financial institutions which contributed $1.4 billion towards the project in loans are pressing the government to help end the crisis a source told Reuters. We have asked the government for help. We are awaiting their reply the source who is employed with a large financial institution said. The domestic lenders to the project are Industrial Development Bank of India  ICICI Ltd  Industrial Finance Corporation of India  Canara Bank and State Bank of India . The Dabhol Power Company (DPC) owned 65 percent by Enron last month took the major step of bailing out of the $2.9 billion power project citing non-payment of bills by the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB). The DPC board's move sparked widespread fears that India's image as a safe destination for foreign direct investment would be damaged. POWER STRUGGLE MSEB which is a state-owned utility has been a regular defaulter on payments to DPC saying that it finds the power too costly. It has also backed out on its commitment to buy more power to be produced by the project's second phase which is to begin operations later this year. Last month MSEB said it had paid Dabhol Power 1.34 billion rupees ($28.60 million) for electricity it bought in March. But the payment only partially resolves the total overdue amount of 2.26 billion rupees ($48.2 million) which Enron has been unable to collect even after invoking guarantees issued by the government of Maharashtra India's most industrialised state and the federal government. The state utility still owes Enron payments for power purchases in December and January. The Indian government has maintained that the contract must be renegotiated and has set up a committee to do so. We are concerned and would like the renegotiations to happen fast the source added. The dispute has raised fears that Enron could pull the plug on the project cease providing power to the local state electricity board and perhaps even sell the plant. The plant is good Maharashtra needs power and I am sure buyers can be found the source added. ($1=46.82 Indian rupees). DNC: Special Interests Write Bush Energy Policy 05/03/2001 PR Newswire (Copyright (c) 2001 PR Newswire) WASHINGTON May 3 /PRNewswire/ -- The Democratic National Committee issued the following today: Dick Cheney began dropping hints this week as to what the Bush energy policy will look like and it is long on oil and short on conservation. But something was missing from the coverage of Cheney's announcement: not just who benefits from the Bush plan but who's writing it as well. (Photo: ) It's hard to understate the influence big donors and high-ranking executives have with the Bush Administration. Take Tom Kuhn for example one of the energy executives who came calling when Bush was thinking about actually following through on his pledge to limit carbon dioxide levels. Kuhn a top Bush fundraiser also served on Bush's Energy Department transition advisory team and still enjoys access to the highest reaches of the Bush White House. Not surprisingly then the Big Oil Bush Administration's energy policy could not make Bush's huge donors and the special interests in the energy business any happier. Since the energy industry's problems are Bush's problems the first things on Bush's hit list are the environmental regulations that keep Big Energy in check -- and our country clean. With an energy executive running around the West Wing Bush's energy policy could be summed up as Drill anywhere anytime and keep those checks coming. The Democratic Party is committed to fighting for a balanced energy policy that keeps our country's priorities -- such as a clean environment -- in mind. To learn more about Bush's misplaced priorities and kowtows to the special interests keep reading to find out the Top Ten Paybacks To The Energy Industry and to see how you too can get on the Bush gravy train in Recipe for a Quid Pro Quo courtesy of the Democratic Party's http://www.100DaysofBush.com. BUSH'S TOP TEN PAYBACKS TO THE ENERGY INDUSTRY One of the most obvious and recurring themes of Bush's first 100 days has been the extraordinary influence the oil and gas industry has had in the new administration. Oil and gas interests are some of Bush's top campaign contributors giving more than $3 million to get Bush elected. In exchange Bush has rolled back regulations issued by the Clinton administration on such things as air conditioner efficiency as well as breaking his campaign promise to regulate carbon dioxide emissions. Bush has proposed drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and national monuments. Bush has taken a backseat when it comes to the energy crisis California is experiencing while cutting funding for energy conservation programs. He has also repaid top donors lobbyists and industry officials with key positions throughout his administration. Here is just a sampling of how the oil gas and other energy industries have benefited in Bush's first 100 days: 2 - BUSH TAKES HANDS-OFF APPROACH TO CALIFORNIA CRISIS WHILE ENERGY COMPANIES MAKE MILLIONS Bush Did Little to Aid California in Energy Crisis Fleischer Said Crisis is a California Matter. Bush has done little to aid California in its energy crisis such as refusing to support wholesale price caps on electricity. White House spokesman Ari Fleischer said The president continues to believe that the issue is mostly a California matter dealing with the legislation that is before the state. And the leaders of California are working to address that in their own right. Fleischer also said that Bush wanted to focus on a long term national energy policy. (AAP Newsfeed 1/23/01 Wall Street Journal 1/23/01) Texas Energy Company Accused of Price Gouging to Make Money off California's Energy Crisis. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ordered further inquiry into allegations by California officials that El Paso Natural Gas Co. a Houston based subsidiary of El Paso Energy Co. manipulated the natural gas market by keeping supply artificially low contributing to the high price of electricity in the state. El Paso Energy was one of the Texas firms grandfathered by Bush's voluntary emissions standards in Texas. Between 1993 and 1998 El Paso Energy and El Paso Natural Gas PACs gave a total of $8000 to Bush's gubernatorial campaigns. During the 1999-2000 election cycle El Paso Energy Corp. and El Paso Natural Gas Co. gave a total of $743029 to Bush and the GOP -- $460395 to GOP in soft money $247750 to GOP candidates from its PAC and $34884 to the Bush campaign from its employees and executives.

LONDON May 3 (Reuters) - British utility Innogy said on Thursday it had started trading wholesale electricity on the French-Italian border and was set to enter the German power market. We have done some wholesale trading on the Italy-France border moving power from France to Italy and we are very close to doing some in Germany said director of trading Tony West in an interview with Reuters. This year we will significantly increase our trading in (mainland) Europe we are discussing relationships with counterparties at the moment he added. Innogy is building a European power trading team at its headquarters in Swindon southern England from where it already trades the UK gas and power markets. FRANCE COULD BE KEY MARKET West said the company initially had expected the main focus of its European trading strategy to be Germany and the north west of the continent. But the early signs were that France would also play a key role particularly as Innogy had gained access to capacity in the UK-France undersea interconnector cable. France has taken me by surprise. It might be more important than we anticipated although there are clearly still issues about the speed of liberalisation said West. A core of about eight companies regularly trade power in France including TXU Europe Enron and a trading alliance between Endesa and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter according to traders. West said Innogy had so far concentrated on buying power in France not always from French companies and taking it to Italy via the cross border interconnector between the two countries. Innogy had bought some of the 400-megawatts available on the interconnector through recent auctions he said. It's easy to trade through France the cost of taking power through to the border is minuscule although buying power in France and then selling it in France is a lot more difficult said West. He said Innogy had signed grid balancing agreements with French transmission grid operator RTE. Andy Duff managing director of generation and trading added France could become become important for Innogy on a retail level as well as a trading level depending on how effectively the UK-France interconnector could be used. The European market will be driven by the operation of interconnectors and transmission services as well as exchanges said Duff. Innogy may look to trade on Germany's two power exchanges as well as that country's burgeoning over-the-counter market. The company is in the process of signing standard trading agreements for Germany based on the terms devised by the industry group the European Federation of Energy Traders (EFET). FOCUS ON TRADING NOT ASSETS Duff said Innogy's strategy in Europe was to focus on trading but not the acquisition of physical assets. We are not going to lead with assets in Europe. We will focus on trading services-type arrangements extracting value from (other companies') assets. That's the main thrust of the business he said. West said Innogy's trading in mainland Europe would expand into natural gas as opportunities emerged. The company already trades around the UK-Belgium gas interconnector. Mosaic Group posts strong first quarter results 05/03/2001 Canada NewsWire (Copyright Canada NewsWire 2001) -- Diluted Cash Earnings per Share Increases by 29% and Revenues up by 89% -- TORONTO May 3 /CNW/ - Mosaic Group Inc. (MGX:TSE) Canada's leading outsourced marketing services agency announced today that it continued its trend of strong earnings growth for the period ending March 31 2001. Posting its 18th consecutive quarter of year over year revenue growth Mosaic has also reported an average quarterly organic growth rate of 27% since 1996. Financial highlights from continuing operations(x) for this quarter include: - Revenues at $171.8 million - up 89% or $80.7 million from Q1 2000. Mosaic has consistently outpaced the growth of its peers within an industry that is clearly expanding said Mike Preston Chairman and CEO Mosaic Group Inc. We have posted 18 consecutive quarters of continued growth while adding to our blue chip client list. We are building our business by taking our clients' business farther every time we deal with them. Our organic growth comes not only from securing new client wins but from the cross-selling wins that are characteristic of a mature company able to leverage a robust and diverse range of service offerings.

British Telecom's 10-year euro-denominated bonds sold in January yield about 214 basis points more than government debt down from a record 238 in March. Contracts that pay out if the company goes bankrupt have also fallen in the past month according to Enron Corp. which trades the derivatives. Bond yields and bankruptcy derivatives have also declined for Deutsche Telekom and Royal KPN NV after the companies said they would sell assets to pay down debt that has pushed their credit ratings to record lows and weighed on their shares. Phone companies sold $100 billion of bonds last year to finance licenses and equipment for new mobile services. British Telecom said yesterday it will sell its stakes in Japan Telecom Co. and Spain's Airtel SA to Vodafone Group for 4.8 billion pounds. British Telecom may also sell as much as 7.5 billion pounds of shares to existing investors in a so-called rights offer according to Legal & General Group Plc one of the company's shareholders. Deutsche Telekom will sell assets such as cable television and a stake in Global One and Wind SpA Chief Financial Officer Karl-Gerhard Eick said last week. KPN the biggest Dutch phone company said on March 26 it plans to raise at least 5 billion euros from asset sales to lower debt. Those plans have helped shift investors' perceptions of the companies' creditworthiness money managers said. `Drastic Measures' ``At the beginning of the year the market was assuming telecoms companies would be downgraded from single-A to triple- B'' said Peter Harvey who helps run about $8.6 billion at F&C Management. ``Drastic measures such as deeply-discounted rights issues led investors to believe they will maintain their single-A status.'' The gap or spread between British Telecom's sterling denominated bonds maturing in 2006 and U.K. five-year government bonds has narrowed 50 basis points to 109 basis points in the past month. Spreads between Deutsche Telekom's 6.125 percent five- year euro bonds and German government debt narrowed 35 basis points to 107 in April. Bankruptcy Swaps Fall Those shifts in sentiment are also reflected in Enron's bankruptcy swaps where prices have fallen in the past month said Simon Brooks a trader at Enron. Enron prices the swaps using indexes that measure the probability of bankruptcy and the likely recovery rate in that event. The price is expressed as a percentage above a benchmark interest rate such as the London interbank offered rate or Libor. British Telecom bankruptcy swaps have declined to 66 basis points from 96 on April 1 Enron said. Bankruptcy swaps on Deutsche Telekom dropped to 78 from 100 while KPN's fell to 135 from 183. Over the same period France Telecom SA's declined to 70 from 100 and Telecom Italia SpA's fell to 94 from 119. British Telecom's bond yields may fall further relative to government debt analysts said. They still offer higher yields than those of rival Vodafone Group Plc which has the same ratings though with a stable outlook. While both companies have five-year euro-denominated bonds British Telecom's offer 55 basis points more yield. The rivals also both have bonds maturing in 2004 and Vodafone's yield about 23 basis points fewer. ``If BT retains their rating their spreads should be probably 20 to 30 basis points narrower'' said Brian Venables head of credit strategy at WestLB. ``Even though it has performed extremely well this year there is much greater potential for BT's debt.'' Debt Reduction Target Both Moody's Investors Service which rates British Telecom ``A2'' and Standard & Poor's which rates it ``A'' have those ratings on watch for further cuts after trimming them four rungs last year. The company's asset sales to Vodafone are ``definitely positive in terms of the rating assessment'' said Aidan Fisher who rates British Telecom for Moody's. In combination with the proceeds of a rights sale ``that would meet the target they set themselves this year -- that's quite a lot to achieve in a 12 month period.'' British Telecom has said it wants to slash its 30 billion pounds of debt by a third and fend off further rating cuts. Before companies such as British Telecom clarified their debt-reduction plans ``the world and his wife were underweight'' telecom bonds in March said Harvey at F&C. The investment firm has since raised its holding of telecom bonds to neutral from underweight relative to its benchmark he said. Bond yields ``were trading very much out of line to the rest of the market'' said Lees-Jones at M&G. Now ``they have come in quite a bit and will come in further.'' --Tom Kohn and Alice James in the London newsroom (44-20) 7330 7929 or at tkohn@bloomberg.net with reporting by Christine Harper /zls Story illustration: {CRED <GO>} to see credit analysis on Bloomberg. {BRITEL <Corp> <GO>} for BT's bonds. {DT <Corp> <GO>} for Deutsche Telekom's bonds. UK:Corporates warm to charms of credit derivatives By Tom Bergin 05/03/2001 Reuters English News Service (C) Reuters Limited 2001. LONDON May 3 (Reuters) - European corporates are beginning to turn to credit derivatives among the more esoteric and complex of financial instruments to hedge the risk their debtors won't pay up market participants said on Thursday. Credit derivatives are insurance-like tools that allow users to hedge the risk of default on a debt. They are mainly used by banks hedge funds and insurance companies to hedge or gain exposure to the risk of a bond issuer defaulting. Dealers said an environment of deteriorating credit quality and a growing awareness among corporates that credit derivatives offer certain advantages over established hedging tools was behind the increasing use of the instruments. The market remains small with only around a dozen non-financial European corporates regularly using credit derivatives to manage their credit portfolio at present. But market professionals predict they will one day become as commonplace in the corporate world as other hedging tools such as interest rate swaps and currency options. We see (corporate use) as a big growth area for credit derivatives maybe the biggest says Bryan Seyfried vice-president of Enron Credit in London. Enron Credit grew out of the efforts of energy company Enron Corp. to hedge its own credit risk portfolio and now specialises in marketing credit risk management solutions to other non-financial corporates. Ralf Lierow director of credit derivatives at Siemens Financial Services in Munich said the ability to buy and sell in a liquid market means credit derivatives offer a flexibility that established tools like credit insurance and forfaiting guarantees lack. Credit derivatives were are often cheaper than the alternatives too he added. This is not a trading book thing. For us the credit default swap is another tool for credit risk management Lierow said. HELPS OPERATIONAL UNITS DO MORE BUSINESS Siemens Financial Services acts as the centralised risk portfolio management operation for companies within the Siemens electronics and industrial group. It first started using credit derivatives in July 2000. Large companies like Siemens can have hundreds of millions of dollars in receivables on their books at any time. The efficiency with which these companies manage the credit risk on their receivables has an impact on their day to day business. The advantage for the operative area is that they can offload more receivables and do more business Lierow said. Siemens uses credit default swaps the most liquid type of credit derivatives to hedge its portfolio of debtors on a constant basis. As the balance of cash owed by each name fluctuates over time the company tries to match this with default swap positions. Hence if a customer fails to pay Siemens can recoup the debt from the default swap seller. Other companies use credit derivatives less frequently. There are occasional corporate users that have secured one-off requirements for balance-sheet management aims or to strip out the credit risk of a commercial transaction said Walter Gontarek head of global credit products at RBC Dominion Securities. By hedging a country or company risk which a corporate may not be comfortable in carrying a credit derivative can facilitate a project that may otherwise be unfeasible dealers said. NOT PUT OFF BY BAD PRESS Corporates' adoption of credit derivatives is in spite of the negative publicity the instruments have received in recent years. A number of disputes over whether protection buyers could force banks to pay up on contracts have ended up in court. However traders insist that subsequent work done on contract documentation minimises the risk of such disputes in future. Nonetheless a very practical concern for corporates remains in that credit derivatives documentation was designed by bankers with sovereign and corporate bonds in mind. The International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) standard documentation for credit default swaps allows for a pay-out in relation to defaults on bond payments but not on a private debtor's failure to pay. We use the ISDA framework but we need it redrafted in specific ways to fit our needs. You cannot take a standard contract and trade on it if you want to hedge trade receivables Lierow said. These amendments add to the cost of the credit derivative. Another problem that corporates face is the complexity of credit derivatives. There is little experience of the instruments which are barely a decade old in the corporate world. Siemens had to get its expertise from the financial markets hiring Lierow from Bankgesellschaft Berlin. Clive Banks UK head of derivatives sales to buy-side clients at Schroder Salomon Smith Barney said much of the effort in marketing credit derivatives to corporates involves educating them about the products and the risks involved. It's about explaining credit risk management and what kind of volatility and cost having credit risk introduces he said. OUTLOOK PROMISING Yet some corporates are beginning to take full advantage of their new tool. Lierow said that Siemens which currently only buys credit protection planned to start acting as a default swaps seller in the coming months. He said selling would facilitate better matching of protection levels to actual exposures and would enable diversification of risk away from industry sectors where the company's activities are concentrated. You could improve the portfolio mix by buying protection on automotives and selling protection on pharmaceuticals he said. Allegheny Energy buys three power plants 05/03/2001 Associated Press Newswires Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. HAGERSTOWN Md. (AP) - Allegheny Energy Inc. said Thursday it has purchased three power plants from Houston-based Enron Corp. The company said it issued more than 14 million shares of common stock worth $667 million to pay for the transaction. The plants are in Tennessee Indiana and Illinois. The Midwestern purchase will bring an additional 1710 megawatts on line. The company is expected to own 14000 megawatts of generating power by 2005. Allegheny also has plans to build natural gas-fired facilities in Arizona Indiana and Pennsylvania. Allegheny Energy is the parent of Allegheny Power which supplies electricity and natural gas to 3 million people in Maryland Ohio Pennsylvania Virginia and West Virginia. Allegheny Energy Buys Midwest Capacity From Enron Unit 05/03/2001 Dow Jones News Service (Copyright (c) 2001 Dow Jones & Company Inc.) HAGRSTOWN Md. -(Dow Jones)- Allegheny Energy Inc.'s (AYE) Allegheny Energy Supply Co. unit purchased 1710 megawatts of natural gas-fired merchant generating capacity in three Midwest states from Enron Corp.'s (ENE) Enron North America unit. Financial terms weren't disclosed. In a press release Thursday Allegheny said it financed the acquisition through debt and equity and expects the purchase to add to earnings in 2001 excluding transaction costs. Allegheny noted that this latest acquisition gives Allegheny Energy Supply more than 14000 MW of total generating capacity that it will own or control by 2005. Allegheny Energy Global Markets will market output from the three facilities. On April 27 Allegheny priced its public offering of 12.4 million shares at $48.25 each and said it would use the $598.3 million in gross proceeds to fund its previously reported acquisition of generating facilities located in the Midwest and for other corporate purposes. New York Stock Exchange-listed shares of Allegheny recently traded at $49.85 down 51 cents or 1% on composite volume of 306000 shares. Average daily volume is 538773 shares. Allegheny which posted an operating net of $313.7 million or $2.84 a share on revenue of $4.01 billion for the year ended Dec. 31 is an energy company. Company Web site -Karen M. Chow Dow Jones Newswires 201-938-5400 Allegheny Energy Supply Completes Purchase of Midwest Assets Adds 1700 MW to Growing Generation Fleet 05/03/2001 Business Wire (Copyright (c) 2001 Business Wire) HAGERSTOWN Md.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 3 2001--Allegheny Energy Inc. (NYSE: AYE) today announced that its unregulated generation subsidiary Allegheny Energy Supply Company LLC has completed the purchase of 1710 megawatts of natural gas-fired merchant generating capacity in three Midwest states from Enron North America a wholly owned subsidiary of Enron Corp. (NYSE: ENE). The acquisition gives Allegheny Energy more than 14000 MW of total generating capacity that it will own or control by 2005 and marks a significant step in the Company's strategic course toward becoming a national energy supplier. Earlier this year Allegheny Energy Supply acquired 83 MW of coal-fired generation in the Conemaugh Generating Facility near Johnstown Pa. Additionally the Company has announced plans to build a 1080-MW natural gas combined-cycle plant in La Paz County Ariz. a 630-MW natural gas combined-cycle facility near South Bend Ind. and a 540-MW natural gas fired combined-cycle generating facility in Springdale Pa. Another 220 MW of peaking capacity have already been completed in Pennsylvania. The Midwest acquisition was financed through a combination of debt and equity and will be accretive to Allegheny Energy's earnings in 2001 excluding transaction costs and other costs related to the integration. Yesterday the Company issued more than 14 million shares of common stock to facilitate the transaction. Alan J. Noia Chairman of the Board President and Chief Executive Officer of Allegheny Energy said I am pleased to announce the closing of Allegheny Energy's largest generation acquisition to date. It provides our Company with significant generation presence and capability as an energy merchant to sell electricity from efficient natural gas-fired generation facilities in more areas of the country with a growing demand for energy. Output from the three facilities will be marketed by Allegheny Energy Global Markets. These premium generating assets are designed for operation in times of peak electricity demand said Noia. Because of its national presence Allegheny Energy Global Markets will be able to market the output from these newly acquired facilities in a wide variety of ways with our portfolio of existing assets and other supply arrangements so that overall operational efficiency and shareholder value is maximized. Allegheny Energy Supply's newly acquired facilities include: the Gleason Tenn. plant (546 MW) approximately 40 miles north of Jackson Tenn. the Wheatland Ind. plant (508 MW) approximately 70 miles northeast of Evansville Ind. and the Lincoln Energy Center plant (656 MW) in Manhattan Ill. near Chicago. These assets give Allegheny Energy Supply additional generating capacity within the East Central Area Reliability region (ECAR) and initial generation sources in the Mid-America Interconnected Network (MAIN) and the Southeastern Electric Reliability Council (SERC). Salomon Smith Barney acted as financial advisor and Jones Day Reavis & Pogue acted as legal counsel for Allegheny Energy for the acquisition.

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Salomon Smith Barney's utility analysts sharply cut their forecast of the profitability of generating electricity in the U.S. in 2002 and beyond because power prices are expected to drop more sharply than natural gas prices starting next year. The analysts cut the profit margin in natural gas-fired power in 2003 to $3.98 a megawatt-hour from $8.73/MWh a 54% difference from their last forecast in February. They lowered their power price index for 2002 by 1.5% and for 2003 by 7.1% Thursday in a published report. Their forecast is based on forward markets for electricity and gas. Gas prices are remaining strong for a much longer period of time while power prices drop off senior electricity industry analyst Raymond Niles said in a telephone conference with investors. As a result stock prices for power producers such as AES Corp. (AES) Mirant (MIR) Calpine Corp. (CPN) and NRG Energy (NRG) could peak this summer in advance of strong third quarter earnings reports the Salomon report says. Investors may still shy away from asset and investment-heavy power producers if realized prices begin to reflect the decreases in power prices now projected in the forward curve the report warns. After this summer the stocks of energy companies that focus more on trading will regain momentum Salomon expects. These energy merchant companies such as Enron Corp. (ENE) Williams Cos. (WMB) Duke Energy (DUK) and Dynegy (DYN) should be able to take advantage of higher trading volume and greater volatility in power markets in non-summer months according to Salomon. We expect (annual trading) volumes to grow industry-wide between 25% and 40% on average during 2001-03 as the $800 billion global energy commodity market continues to open the report predicts. The overall electricity price trend is national according to Salomon. The report titled Power Curve expects 2001 wholesale power prices to exceed last year's by 131% in the West and by 34% on average in the eastern U.S. including Texas. But since their last forecast the analysts lowered their forward price curve for next year and beyond in 10 of 11 regional power pools. Interestingly the exception to that is the New York Power Pool Niles told investors. For the remainder of this year however Salomon still expects power producers to beat substantially last year's breakthrough results. About 50% of the spike upward in western U.S. power prices the past six months has been from something we've never seen before in this industry: political and credit risk Niles said in the conference. Western merchant power suppliers are benefitting from the unholy mess in California Niles said but that won't last forever. Whenever the debate tapers off and we have a resolution in sight that premium will slowly drain out of the western markets and bring down profitability for the group Niles said. National calls for reregulation due to the California crisis could continue to hurt stock prices for the entire sector even though reregulation won't happen. Further in so far as such calls discourage investment in generating plants transmission lines and gas pipelines they could also extend the current period of extremely high earnings according to the report. In non-western states the greatest profitability from power generation for the next two years is seen in New England. -By Mark Golden Dow Jones Newswires 201-938-4604 mark.golden@dowjones.com Fitch Affs Northern Border Rtg Outlook To Stable From Negative 05/03/2001 Business Wire (Copyright (c) 2001 Business Wire) NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 3 2001--Fitch has affirmed its `BBB+' senior debt rating for Northern Border Partners L.P. (NBP) and its `A-` senior debt rating for its regulated pipeline affiliate Northern Border Pipeline Co. (NBPL). The Rating Outlook for both companies is changed to Stable from Negative. The rating action was taken after a review of NBP's recent acquisitions and long-term business plan. A combination of debt and equity at NBP was used to fund the recent acquisitions of Bear Paw LLC Midwestern Gas Transmission Company and Dynegy Canada midstream assets. An additional $125-150 million of equity is expected to be sold in the coming months to pay down short-term debt and complete the permanent financing. The improvement in Rating Outlook primarily reflects NBP's demonstrated commitment to undertake conservative long-term financing and operating strategies. Future acquisitions at the partnership level are expected to be financed 50/50 debt/equity so as to maintain financial flexibility and a stable credit profile. Moreover management has shown a strong bias to minimize commodity price risk as it expands its non-regulated gas operations. For example processing contracts for Bear Paw's four processing facilities are contracted for on a percentage of proceeds basis and liquids prices have been 90% hedged by NBP through 2001 limiting downside exposure. NBPL continues to exhibit strong competitive market operating and financial characteristics that are consistent with its current `A-` rating. The company is a low-cost transporter of Canadian gas into the Midwest with costs per hundred miles of less than 4 cents per mcf. The December 2000 completion of the Alliance Pipeline has had minimal impact on Northern Border as capacity utilization approaches 100%. Pipeline capacity is 99% subscribed through mid-September 2003. Its shippers are financially strong customers with uniform take-or-pay contracts. The company has never written off a bad debt. NBPL should generate EBITDA/interest coverage of nearly 4.0 times over the next few years. Credit concerns primarily relate to NBP's changing business mix and the expectation of increased market risk associated with its growing midstream operations as compared with the stable low-risk profile of NBPL. While projected consolidated and stand alone credit measures at NBP remain relatively strong there will be less predictability in the future cash stream utilized to service debt. NBP is a publicly traded master limited partnership. Its primary holding is a 70% economic interest in NBPL a 1214-mile FERC regulated interstate pipeline transporting natural gas from the Canadian border to the upper Midwest. Enron Corp. and The Williams Companies Inc. hold a 10.0% and 3.3% stake in NBP respectively with the remainder publicly held. Enron controls an 82.5% stake in the management committee of NBP with Williams holding the remaining management allocation.

NEW DELHI May 3 (Reuters) - The Indian unit of Enron Corp said on Thursday that its officials would meet members of a government panel formed to re-negotiate a troubled $2.9 billion power project in western India. But the willingness to meet the panel next week should not be construed as an offer to renegotiate the contract Dabhol Power Company (DPC) said in a statement. As a matter of courtesy we have agreed to meet with them next week the DPC statement said. Since the purpose of our meeting is to hear out the committee and understand their thoughts we will not present any proposal. DPC said it had constantly maintained that it was open to maintaining a dialogue towards resolving issues. (But) This meeting should in no manner be construed as an open offer from DPC to renegotiate the terms of the contract it added. DPC and the government of the western state of Maharashtra have been locked in a payment battle for months with the state's electricity board balking at paying Enron what it considers too high a rate for electricity. At present Maharashtra's State Electricity Board (MSEB) owes the DPC of which Enron is a 65 percent stakeholder some $48 million for power. The Maharashtra government last week announced the formation of a panel of experts to re-negotiate its contract with DPC and lower the cost of power sold to MSEB. LARGEST FOREIGN INVESTMENT The Dabhol project the single largest foreign investment in India consists of two phases the already-built 740 megawatt power plant and a 1444 MW plant that is expected to be finished this year. Last week Dabhol's board authorised the plant's managing director to issue a preliminary notice of termination of service to MSEB. The notice which has not been issued would be the first step for Enron to pull out of the project. Earlier a source familiar with the project told Reuters that Indian lenders who have provided millions of dollars to Houston-based Enron to build DPC are lobbying with the government to act quickly and end the crisis. We have asked the government for help. We are awaiting their reply the source who is employed with a large financial institution said. The domestic lenders to the project are Industrial Development Bank of India  ICICI Ltd  Industrial Finance Corporation of India  Canara Bank and State Bank of India . If Enron pulls out of the project the source said the lenders would have no choice but to seek an alternative buyer. The plant is good Maharashtra needs power and I am sure buyers can be found the source added. India State Panel's Sat Meet With Enron Unit Postponed 05/03/2001 Dow Jones International News (Copyright (c) 2001 Dow Jones & Company Inc.) NEW DELHI -(Dow Jones)- India's Maharashtra state government's expert committee's Saturday meeting with the U.S. energy major Enron Corp.'s (ENE) Indian unit Dabhol Power Co. has been postponed until May 11 at the request of DPC a committee member told Dow Jones Newswires late Thursday. The nine-member committee has been appointed to renegotiate the Maharashtra State Electricity Board's controversial power purchase agreement with DPC. The state government has asked the committee to try to negotiate a revised agreement within a month. The negotiating committee's first meeting with the Dabhol Power Co. management scheduled for Saturday has been postponed until May 11 0530 GMT at DPC's request. They (DPC) told us they wanted some more time to prepare themselves for the meeting and we have granted their request said a committee member. The committee's goals are to lower the power tariff and allow the sale of excess power to the federal government or its utilities. A restructure of the DPC's stakeholding may also be on the agenda. -By Himendra Kumar Dow Jones Newswires 91-11-461-9427 himendra.kumar@dowjones.com EnergieKontor Secures Enron Deal For Spain Germany Projs 05/03/2001 Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001 Dow Jones & Company Inc.) LONDON -(Dow Jones)- German wind farm developer EnergieKontor AG said Thursday it has signed a framework agreement with Enron Wind GmbH for deliveries of wind turbines for projects in Germany and Spain. In all Enron will deliver 200 megawatts' worth of 1.5 MW turbines for onshore projects in EnergieKontor's home market and in Spain one of its fastest-growing export markets. In addition Neuer Markt-listed EnergieKontor said it has entered into exclusive negotiations with the local authorities for permission to build up to 15 wind farms at a number of sites in the Castilla-La Mancha region.

Smith Dow Jones Newswires (+44 20) 7842 9260 -geoffrey.smith@dowjones.com The Bottom Line: Scottish Power Looks To Refine Focus By Andrea Chipman Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 05/03/2001 Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001 Dow Jones & Company Inc.) LONDON -(Dow Jones)- After more than a year of lagging earnings investment missteps and unexpected disasters U.K. vertically-integrated utility Scottish Power (SPI) is hoping a new strategy to streamline its businesses will signal a more focused period for the company. But it's got its work cut out. While investors were cheered by news that its U.S. Utah-based Hunter power plant is back online after a six-month outage that cost the company an estimated $160 million uncertainty over its plans for its Southern Water unit and apparent ongoing commitment to loss-making telecoms venture Thus are seen as muddling group focus. It all adds up - the lack of coherent strategy quite substantial downgrades and a whole host of non-core businesses that they don't have any natural management flair or expertise in said Brian Gallagher a senior fund manager at London-based Gartmore Investment Management which has GBP3 million of Scottish Power shares in its Global Utilities Fund. We have a reasonably low opinion of the company. The company said Thursday that its pretax profit before goodwill amortization and exceptional items for the fiscal year ending March 31 fell to GBP628 million from GBP736 million a year ago. Adjusted earnings per share declined to 30.65 pence in the 2001 fiscal year from 41.22 pence in 2000. The company acknowledged profits have been hit hard by the Hunter outage competition on wholesale and retail markets in the U.K. and strict price controls on its regulated infrastructure businesses. Although the company's shares were trading at 458.5 pence after the release of Thursday's earnings results up from 441.5 pence Wednesday they are down more than 15% from 533 pence a year ago. Executives say they are restructuring the business into three targeted divisions to capitalize on its traditional strengths in generation and power supply and infrastructure and to expand its overseas activities. We've now got a trading and commercial link between generation and supply and the first thing we are doing is putting emphasis on that...on growing earnings across that value chain Scottish Power Chief Executive Ian Russell told journalists in a conference call Thursday. In the U.S. we are focused on cost cutting and on acquiring new businesses. Scottish Power's move away from a full multi-utility profile - begun last year with its partial disposal of Thus and its withdrawal from an Internet banking venture with the Royal Bank of Scotland - toward a more narrowly focused energy business mimics a trend across the industry toward greater specialization. The company is also considering selling Southern Water which would allow it to focus even more closely on its power business. Yet analysts and investors say they are looking for more details of the company's overall growth strategy from Russell who took over as chief executive last month and other managers. The toll from months of drift is evident they said. Sales Of Southern Water Thus Seen Indeed despite its efforts to chart a new road Scottish Power appears to be reluctant to acknowledge the failure of some of its non-core ventures. Russell said his company remains supportive of Thus which reported a 2000 fiscal year loss of GBP21.4 million this week and has no plans to exit its remaining 50% stake in the company. Similarly he said Scottish Power hasn't yet made a final decision to dispose of Southern Water - which has cut costs under its Scottish parent but is increasingly unable to cover its capital expenditure - although he said the company had received a number of offers from potential buyers. Although he declined to identify any of the bidders Italian energy company Enel SpA (ENI) has confirmed its interest. Industry sources said a prompt sale of the water unit looks likely with some bids already exceeding the GBP2 billion at which many analysts value the company's combined assets and debt. It's unclear they said how Southern Water or Thus would fit into Scottish Power's new image. Scottish Power sees itself as an international energy company a source familiar with the company said. In a year's time he added it would be unlikely that Southern Water and Thus would be part of the company. Revenues from the sale of the water unit would also help Scottish Power pursue its U.S. expansion without adding to its 90% gearing levels analysts and investors said. Russell declined to comment on reports Scottish Power is considering buying Enron Corp.'s Oregon-based unit Portland General but admitted the company would be a logical geographical fit with Pacificorp. Analysts said Scottish Power's plans for U.S. growth is likely to be a key part of its energy strategy. We like their U.S. strategy where they've leveraged expertise gained in the highly competitive U.K. market said Gareth Lewis-Davies head of utilities research at Lehman Brothers in London. Closer to home competition and the trend toward increased specialization in the power industry may force Scottish Power to determine whether its business strength lies in asset management or retail and generation. Strategic decisions need to be made and I'm not sure if they are going to make them in the near term or not said Andrew Wright U.K. utilities analyst at UBS Warburg in London. They are pretty much involved across the value chain and I think it remains to be seen which part of the value chain they specialize in if any.

148,Privileged and Confidential - Catalytica,I've finished marking up the drafts and thought perhaps a few thoughts would give you some insight into the reasons for my revisions . Unfortunately I was engaged in discussions about the course to pursue in light of Arthur Anderson's comments until almost 10pm when I lost my typing help so not much headway was made in inputting the changes last night. My secretary is supposed to be in early ( it is now nearly 8:00 and she still isn't in ! ) and I will enlist whatever other help I can get to turn these documents around. For those not involved in the discussions last night Roger advised us that Arthur Anderson had changes to the Xonon Technology Implementation Agreement designed to make clear ENA had no primary or secondary obligations under the XTIA. The principal change suggested by AA - the deletion of the last sentence of the BOLD language in Section 2.2 - removed the obligation for ENA to pick up any obligations under the agreement owed by West LB in excess of the Cap. Note that this same change applies in the Agreement in Principle related to the purchase of turbines. XTIA Revision 4G. AA's change did not appear to address comprehensively the principle AA espoused ie clarifying ENA had no primary or secondary obligations under the agreements. After much discussion and some consideration I decided to prepare alternative markups of the XTIA - one that attempts to meet the AA directive while preserving a level of comfort for GE. I attempted this by increasing the limit on West LB's liability in Article 10 to $20 million from $9.9 million so that GE's recourse against West LB is the same as it had against West LB and ENA in the prior drafts and by obligating West LB in the default provisions to pony up for an ENA default. I also extensively modified the Section 2.2 language ( taken verbatim from the LM 6000 deal ) to eliminate the limited recourse provisions favoring West LB and in doing so made it easier to conclude that references to ENA in the agreement are references to ENA acting in an agency and not its individual capacity. This notion is still pretty vague in the revision because I did not want to create too much discomfort in GE since ENA explicitly acting in an agency capacity would mean there was no recourse against it ( since ultimate recourse would lie with the principal West LB). Roger suggested I delete the limit on ENA's liability in Article 10 to remove the implication it had any which I did ( and which means we have no upside protection if we are construed to have obligations under the XTIA. The upshot is that in my opinion the 4g revision goes as far as possible toward placating AA while still retaining a possibility of selling it to GE. The sheer number of changes required by the substance of AA's comment however is bound to be disconcerting to GE at this stage of negotiations particularly when GE's expectation was for a markup incorporating the new business terms agreed yesterday afternoon (calling for payment of the Development Funds to be completed by September 302000 with the possibility of a refund of a portion of the Development Fund Payment if the December 31 Milestone is not timely completed) and some clean ups/clarifications. Note that in both revision 4g and 4ga Section4.3 now provides that the Xonon credit created is only exercisable by CCSI on and after December 312000 so that the credit amount can reflect the deduction of any Milestone 4 refund amount paid by GE if it does not complete that Milestone on time. I think the dollar value of the credit should be adjusted downward if a portion of the Development Funds paid on September 30 are in fact refunded in December. We need to make sure to make provision in the Acquisition and Development Agreement that any Milestone 4 refund received by West LB is paid over to ENA since West LB will have been repaid its advances on September 302000. XTIA Revision 4GA . This alternate revision to the XTIA takes a minimalist approach and incorporates only the new business terms some minor clean up/clarifications and the AA change to Section 2.2 and the change to Article 10 ( to remove a cap for ENA's laibility) suggested by Roger. It seems to me it does not address meaningfully the AA admonition that ENA may not have primary or secondary liability under the XTIA if it wants to stay outside of the rigors of FAS 97-10. However it has the singular advantage of looking a lot like what GE and West LB expect to see in the revision. Option Repurchase Agreement. This revision was complicated by the possible refund of the a portion of the Development Funds by GE if it failed to complete Milestone 4 by December 312000 ( an attempt to retain some accountability for GE's performance given that it is being paid for that Milestone on September 30 to satisfy CCSI ). Because the option repurchase must occur on or before September 30 it isn't clear what will happen December 31 so its hard to figure out what to pay if the contract is not cancelled by September 30 or what the credits are worth on that date. Since CCSI is the direct recipient of the credits under the XTIA I first thought ENA could hang onto $2.1 million ( the amount formerly allocated to Milestone 4 before its payment obligation was collapsed into Milestone 3) by deducting the refund from the amount payable to CCSI on the option repurchase date and leaving CCSI to bear the risk of GE's repayment of any refund in order to make CCSI whole. If GE did meet the Milestone on time and so did not pay the refund amount directly to CCSI I thought ENA could always make CCSI whole by paying the $2.1 million in December when the refund matter was decided. That approach- subtracting the refund amount from the September 30 payment to CCSI- was decidedly unsatisfactory since the option repurchase formula could result - depending on the Milestones paid on the option repurchase date - in a negative payment to CCSI for the option. What I settled on in this draft was to go ahead and pay CCSI the amount of the premiums it has paid to September 30 plus $200000 if the turbine contract has not been cancelled on September 30. This would include repayment to CCSI on September 30 of premiums paid by CCSI under the spark spread on September 30. Assuming CCSI made all its premium payments and West LB made all of its Development Fund advances ENA would have received $9.9 million from CCSI by September 30 paid out $9.9 million plus interest to West LB by September 30 and purchased the spark spread from CCSI for $10.1 million. If the turbine contract is not cancelled but GE has to pay the refund I think the $2.1 million ought to go to West LB or its designee (ENA). If we cancel the turbine contract and do not go forward with Pastoria the dollar amount of the credits vested in CCSI and exercisable after December 312000 are equal to the Development Funds advanced less the refund amount. Since the document now reads that the $2.1 refund amount goes back to West LB or its designee if GE pays the refund and CCSI is holding a Xonon credit of only $7.8 millionit seems to me it will be necessary to pay the refund over to CCSI instead of ENA in order to make up for the fact that it paid $9.9 in premium and only received $7.8 in credit in September. This quick liquidation of $2.1 of the credit seems to be an ancillary benefit to CCSI occasioned by GE's refund. We could provide in the agreements that GE makes this payment directly to CCSI or we can continue to have the right to receive the payment from GE under the XTIA and the obligation to pay it to CCSI under the Repurchase Agreement.,"Business; Legal; Contracts; Negotiation

J= effords has never mattered much to Californians. Until now. The Verm= ont senator's widely anticipated decision to abandon his fellow Republican= s and put Democrats in control of the Senate could have big implications f= or California particularly on energy and environmental policy lawmakers = and lobbyists said Wednesday. The change which Jeffords is expected= to announce today could increase political pressure on the Bush adminis= tration to respond more aggressively to California's electricity crisis t= hese insiders said. And it might force the White House to compromise= on key elements of the national energy policy it unveiled last week. In f= act the administration's proposed budget cuts for programs to promote ren= ewable energy were said to be a factor in Jeffords' decision. At th= e very least Senate observers said Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) is l= ikely to get the floor vote she has sought on price controls for wholesale= electricity. That doesn't necessarily mean that the administration'= s critics will be able to have everything their way. Even if the Senate ap= proves electricity price caps for example the measure would face stiff o= pposition in the GOP-dominated House--and a likely veto if it made it to t= he president's desk. Still a Democratic majority in the Senate wou= ld give Feinstein and other party members a platform to turn up the politi= cal heat on the administration and congressional Republicans on energy pol= icy. It kicks up the dust groaned one energy industry lobbyist wh= o requested anonymity. Observed Sen. John F. Kerry (D-Mass.): If P= resident Bush's hard-edged conservative approach has in fact caused the ba= lance to shift towards Democrats in the Senate it will have profound impl= ications not just for California but for the environment and our nation's= energy policy. Environmentalists seemed almost giddy as they cont= emplated the possible impact of Jeffords' decision on the policies they ca= re about. All of a sudden they said it seems less likely that oil = exploration will take place in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge that r= ecreational snowmobiles will have free access to Yellowstone National Park=  or that the administration's desire to promote nuclear power will be emb= raced by Congress. On the other hand it seems more probable that C= ongress would approve a new plan for managing a vast swath of the Sierra N= evada to protect the region's oldest trees consider legislation to restri= ct emissions of carbon dioxide from power plants and protect California fr= om a resurgence of offshore oil drilling. It's stunning how broad t= he repercussions are particularly on the environment said Gregory Wetst= one of the Natural Resources Defense Council. We're trying not to count o= ur chickens before they hatch. But it will be easier for us in our battles= at least to keep from moving backwards. For instance Jeffords is= a chief advocate of a bill that would regulate carbon dioxide from power = plants. And if events play out as expected he'll become the new chairman = of the Senate committee with jurisdiction over the issue. Another i= ssue under his purview would be the two-decade dispute over a proposed rep= ository for the nation's spent nuclear fuel at Yucca Mountain in Nevada. = Yucca Mountain is a dead turkey declared Michael Francis of the W= ilderness Society. Environmentalists had been worried that a number= of pro-development provisions would be packed into appropriation bills. B= ut with Democratic senators in charge that would become less of a threat= they said. Every wacko idea Republicans have will get a higher lev= el of scrutiny Francis said. The biggest change would be the power= of Senate Democrats to decide which bills will be considered in committee= s and which ones will make it to the floor of the Senate for votes. = As part of a new Democratic majority Feinstein and fellow California De= mocrat Barbara Boxer are likely to gain leverage with the administration o= n a number of issues considered important to the state. That transl= ates into more federal assistance for California across the board predic= ted Steve Maviglio spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis. I think it mean= s more attention to our state for sure Boxer said. Right now the pres= ident doesn't seem to give a darn. They're all looking at California as a = Democratic state. They're not interested. Feinstein who has been = unable to arrange a meeting with Bush to discuss the energy crisis may ge= t better treatment if winning Democratic support becomes more important to= the administration. She has been regarded as a bridge-builder who worked = effectively with Republicans in the past. This has not been a warm = and friendly administration she complained Wednesday. They've got peopl= e who know all the answers and don't want to listen. The White Hou= se disputed that. In fact Bush agreed Wednesday to meet with Davis during= the president's first visit to California next week. Under a Democ= ratic majority Feinstein would be in line to chair two subcommittees: the= military construction panel of the Senate Appropriations Committee and t= he technology terrorism and government information subcommittee of the Se= nate Judiciary Committee. Boxer would be in line to chair the subco= mmittee on Superfund waste control and risk assessment and the Foreign R= elations subcommittee on international operations and terrorism. Mav= iglio predicted that the effects of Jeffords' expected party defection wou= ld be felt immediately. The chairmanship of the Senate Energy and N= atural Resources Committee would be taken away from Frank H. Murkowski (R-= Alaska) who has been openly hostile to California's plight and handed = to Jeff Bingaman (D-N.M.) who supports Davis' request for electricity pri= ce controls according to Maviglio. Democrats have assailed Bush's e= nergy plan for tilting heavily toward the supply side.

175,Speech to the British Institute of Energy Economists,I agree with Mark's points. While we have advocated our merger with PGE (which did not concentrate market power) we have intervened in opposition to most others. Moreover there is some hope that the German government will take the opportunity to use the proposed utility merger to force greater open access. We will likely encourage that action and may oppose the merger otherwise. Most mergers in this industry are defensive not procompetitive and in my view deserve no credit for convergence innovation or liberlization. -----------------,"Mergers and Acquisitions; Energy Industry; Government Regulation

Most of these moves are attributable new business startups (eg EGM ENW and EIM) and normal course of business transfers within the company.

183,Observations on the Hearings this Week,We're in the process of developing a strategy to take us through the next few months. But while the (otherwise perishable) thoughts are still fresh in my mind from the hearings on Monday and Tuesday I wanted to throw out some observations for discussion in the days/weeks ahead. OBSERVATION--The pressure to finger somebody for price gouging is increasing. The administration is hell bent on finding a fall guy. The price spikes pose real political risks for Davis and he and his folks need and want an easy way out. His press release following the hearing renewed the call for refunds. On my panel Loretta Lynch asked Reliant and Duke to supply her with the details of the contracts they cut to sell their power forward to marketers. And Carl Wood's remarks were extreme. At the Barton hearing a liberal democrat (Filner) and a conservative Republican (Hunter) locked arms in calling for refunds. Bilbray joined the gouging band wagon. The utilities repeatedly called on FERC to do a real investigation with hearings testimony data discovery---the works. On the positive side the FERC commissioners lauded Wolak his analysis and his remarks on the panel. Wolak said somewhat emphatically that the nature of California's market structure makes it impossible to single out a single participant as the culprit. He also stated that just everyone's just acting in their own self-interest responding to the screwed incentives embedded in the structure. IMPLICATION--It seems prudent for Enron to understand better its risks of getting fingered. In the best case the clamoring for a refund subsides. In which case the only cost to Enron is the internal cost incurred to understand better the risks of getting fingered. In the medium case investigations find that Enron (like others) played by the rules but the rules stunk and Enron profited at the expense of California consumers.,"Energy; Politics; FERC; California

186,CalPX Told To Release Confidential Trade Data To ..,CalPX Told To Release Confidential Trade Data To State 09/22/2000 Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2000 Dow Jones&Company Inc.) LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- California's Electricity Oversight Board has ordered the state's Power Exchange to hand over confidential information to the board regarding the trading activities of utilities generation companies and other market participants who traded power at the exchange since June according to a copy of a subpoena obtained by Dow Jones Newswires. The subpoena marks the first time the state will gain access and learn how each company traded power in the day-of day-ahead and block forward markets. Moreover the EOB subpoena requests the CalPX release the names of the participants who traded power at the exchange since June to better understand how and why the participants conduct business in the various markets at the exchange. The CalPX has until Wednesday to hand over aggregate supply and demand curves individual firm bid dates final schedules for each firm by generating unit injection point and take out point from June 1 through September and continue supplying trading data through Nov. 1. In addition the subpoena requests block forward trade positions by firm for June July August and September and that this information continue to be supplied through October and November. The subpoena is part of the state's ongoing investigation into California's troubled deregulated electricity market which has resulted in high wholesale power prices in San Diego landmark legislative action and accusations of collusion price gouging and market power. Gov. Gray Davis ordered an investigation in June when power prices soared to near record levels and rolling blackouts wreaked havoc in the Bay Area. The CalPX said it will comply with the EOB request and that a subpoena to access the confidential information is required according to the rules of the exchange. But the EOB will be required to protect the confidentiality of each trade it gains insight into as well as the identities of the participants who traded. If the trading activities of a company or other participant is leaked or becomes public it could have a devastating affect on the company and the EOB would be held liable according to the CalPX. The CalPX said it must notify each and every participant who traded power in its various markets to alert them of the EOB subpoena. -By Jason Leopold Dow Jones Newswires 323-658-3874 jason.leopold@dowjones.com Folder Name: Utilities Electric: Retail Wheeling Relevance Score on Scale of 100: 53 To review or revise your folder visit Dow Jones CustomClips or contact Dow Jones Customer Service by e-mail at custom.news@bis.dowjones.com or by phone at 800-369-7466.

196,Follow Up On California Information,Just following up on the Monday conference call discussion yesterday with Rick and others about nailing down the numbers and documentation so we can feed the Hill information on the mistakes Governor Davis made last year and this year on power supply contracts. As I understand it there are two aspects of this: 1. The offer of Enron and others last year to sell power to California utilities for 5 cents per kw. Failure to accept these offers resulted in higher power costs in the range of $15 billion as I recall from yesterday's call. 2. The long term contracts that California signed this year after taking actions and making statements that drove up the forward price curves are now under water to the tune of $20 billion. On both counts we will be pressed for assumptions and documentation to pursue these arguments which parallel the comments made by senior management in Capitol Hill meeting last week. We will work on back up on this end but we would greatly appreciate your assistance in this regard as well. With Congress out of session starting COB on Thursday we will need information pulled together by tomorrow COB to get the final product in the hands of congressional types and others who can use it on a timely basis.

RABIN and DARYL KELLEY TIMES STAFF WRITERS The Securities and Exch= ange Commission has launched a preliminary inquiry into whether energy con= sultants advising Gov. Gray Davis used inside information to trade stocks = of power companies doing business with the state a source with knowledge = of the matter said Monday. The federal agency began its review late last = week the source said in response to a request from California Secretary = of State Bill Jones. A Republican rival of Davis Jones charged that stock= trading by consultants may have violated federal laws barring buying and = selling based on information not available to the public. On Friday top = aides to the governor disclosed that five consultants had been fired for = possible conflicts of interest between their official positions and their = personal finances. As news of the SEC inquiry spread through the capital M= onday Davis officials were confronted by a flurry of questions about who = in the administration owns energy stocks. Financial disclosure records fi= led by the governor's spokesman Steve Maviglio show that he owns between= $10000 and $100000 in a Texas company he and his boss have accused of m= aking obscene profits while California has been on its knees. Maviglio= said he bought the shares in Houston-based Enron Corp. in 1996. It's no= t a crime to own energy stock Maviglio said. He also owns 300 shares of= San Jose-based Calpine Corp. which has the largest share of the $43 bill= ion in long-term state power contracts. Maviglio placed the order for the= stock on May 31 one day after San Jose's mayor dropped his opposition to= a controversial Calpine plant favored by the governor and others. Under t= he terms of Maviglio's purchase the transaction was completed about three= weeks later when the stock reached $40 a share a value of $12000. It ha= s since fallen in value. I viewed it as a good long-term investment M= aviglio said adding that he purchased the shares for his retirement accou= nt based on publicly available information. The Davis administration has = spared Calpine the kind of fierce criticisms that it has leveled at other = electricity suppliers such as Enron. But California's grid operator has i= dentified the company as one of many energy merchants to overcharge the st= ate millions of dollars. The fired consultants also owned shares in Calpi= ne ranging in value from several thousand dollars to more than $100000 = records show. Another top Davis administration official legal affairs s= ecretary Barry Goode disclosed in his economic interest statement that he= recently held between $100000 and $1 million in another out-of-state com= pany accused of multimillion-dollar price gouging. In a statement Goode = said he sold his stock in Williams Co's. a month after he began working fo= r the governor in February. Goode said the shares were supposed to be sold= before he went on the state payroll but his broker failed to do so. In = light of the recent disclosures Secretary of State Jones said the governo= r must do more to ensure the public that its interest comes first. The g= overnor should direct all of his staff to immediately file updated conflic= t of interest statements that reflect current holdings and any activity si= nce their last statement of economic interest was filed said Jones who = is seeking the GOP nomination for governor. Word of the SEC's entry into = California's energy problems comes as the governor faces harsh criticism f= rom lawmakers and others for the quick and broad hiring of highly paid pri= vate consultants to guide him through the crisis. In his written request = to the SEC Jones said that recently filed disclosure documents showed tha= t at least one consultant bought and sold shares of two energy companies w= ithin the same month raising a red flag about the possibility of inside= r trading. State law prohibits officials from participating in decisions= involving their personal financial interests. The five consultants fired= last week were among 11 named in Jones' letter delivered to the San Fran= cisco office of the SEC last Wednesday. It was not clear which individuals= are the focus of the SEC's inquiry or whether the agency's review would = result in any charges. Two of the former traders said Monday that they ha= d not been contacted by federal investigators and knew nothing of an inqui= ry into possible insider trading. But William Mead fired Thursday said = it is no mystery why so many of his colleagues owned Calpine stock. Mead = said he bought it 2 1/2 years ago and made so much money he recommended it= to his colleagues last year while they all still worked for the now-defu= nct California Power Exchange in Alhambra. Calpine power was not traded on= that exchange so there was no conflict of interest he said. Mead and = three other energy traders--hired by the state in February and March--were= terminated by the Davis administration for allegedly buying power for the= state from Calpine while owning the company's stock. Fired traders Herman= Leung Peggy Cheng and Constantine Louie did not list the date of their C= alpine purchases on financial statements that the state required to be fil= ed only two weeks ago. But I'm sure they bought it while they were still= at the power exchange because that's when we discussed it Mead said. = It was kind of like a hobby. I'm sure it wasn't done with the intent to ma= nipulate. Former trader Elaine Griffin who also owned Calpine stock and= resigned two weeks ago to take another job said she didn't know she owne= d energy securities until she checked with her financial advisor July 13 = just before leaving her state job. Griffin said she and her husband own a= bout $10000 worth of Calpine stock in individual retirement accounts mana= ged by their advisor who bought the stock Feb. 1 without their knowledge= she said after research found it to be a good investment. I kind of fe= el like we've been used for political reasons Griffin said. We would ha= ve disclosed anything right at first but they never asked. As a trader=  Griffin said she occasionally bought Calpine power for the state but on= ly at market prices. Meanwhile two Democratic political consultants who= helped Davis polish his image after the ongoing energy crisis caused his = poll numbers to plummet have agreed to accept no payment for their work a= s part of an out-of-court settlement of a taxpayer lawsuit. Tom Hiltachk= a lawyer for conservative anti-tax activist Lewis Uhler said the settlem= ent was reached last Friday after negotiations with lawyers for communicat= ions consultants Mark Fabiani and Chris Lehane. Now they will not receiv= e one red cent said Hiltachk. Very simply Mr. Fabiani and Mr. Lehane ha= ve agreed to cease all activities for the governor to accept no payments = for their services and to basically get out of the consulting business wit= h the governor. As his part of the agreement Hiltachk said Uhler with= drew his lawsuit Monday morning. Uhler had filed a lawsuit against the tw= o consultants and Controller Kathleen Connell in June contending that they= should not receive any payments because of a conflict of interest. The tw= o men also did consulting work for financially troubled Southern Californi= a Edison which was seeking help from Davis and the Legislature. Connell= a former Los Angeles mayoral candidate who has been at odds with Davis si= nce he endorsed an opponent had held up the payments pending the outcome = of the lawsuit.

206,Re: FW: fact sheet- latest draft,I think it's a good document and carves out some solid policy ground for Bush. I think the electricity section needs some additions though. There is not a lot that the current administration can do about siting new plants and power lines -- its largely a state and local decision. Further the problem has been less about government failing to provide adequate incentives to utilities than it has been about a failure of the current commission to opening the grid on a nondiscriminatory basis. Once utilities are in the open access transmission business they will look for ways to invest in the grid and stop getting in the way of independent power producers who want to connect to the grid. The answer is open access so power can get from where it is to where it is needed. This has been clear for a long time yet the current administration (and its appointees on FERC) have yet to use their authority to make this happen. The result: spiking prices and reliability problems.

207,Call to Bob Glynn,Per our discussion this morning below is a summary of items to discuss with Glynn: Adding Enron's negative CTC claim to the list of claims: PGE's filing included a list of top twenty creditors. Our negative CTC claim was apparently not taken into account in compiling that list. The list is nonbinding however. PG&E will be required to file schedules of creditors on April 20. Our negative CTC claim should be on Schedule F (for unsecured claims). You may want to remind Glynn of your previous conversations and state our expectation that the negative CTC claim will appear (preferably as uncontested) in the April 20 filing. (Note: if PG&E does not include the claim we have an opportunity to file a proof of claim and ultimately the court determines the validity of the claim). Including Enron on the Creditors' Committee: PG&E may have the opportunity to influence representation on the creditors' committees. There are several reasons to suggest to Glynn that we be included: 1) we are a big creditor 2) we could be helpful in crafting a broader solution and 3) we are one of the real parties in interest behind the PX and ISO (who were listed as significant creditors but are really just passthroughs for the suppliers ... and PG&E likely would not want to have those political bodies serving on the creditors committee anyway).,"Bankruptcy; PG&E; Enron

212,Confidential re: McConville--Indemnity,David As we discussed Mark Haedicke and I discussed the possibility of providing Kevin McConville with some sort of indemnity in order to make sure that he remains available and cooperative during the pendency of the NSM case and other litigation matters. We could agree to enter into a Consulting Services Agreement with Kevin. The terms of that Agreement would include: 1. He agrees to be available and cooperative with Enron and its counsel regarding litigation matters. He will agree to meet with counsel prepare for testimony review documents testify and provide other assistance as needed. 2. Through February 1 2001 Kevin would not be directly compensated for this cooperation/testimony (because he is to be receiving his salary pursuant to the terms of his employment agreement). After Feb.1 2001 he will be paid a rate of $125 per hour for his services in this regard. 3. Enron would agree to indemnify Kevin for his conduct taken in the ordinary course and scope of his employment with Enron up to the last date of his employment with Enron. Excluded from this indemnity would be allegations or claims based upon the following: -- any conduct that is outside the course and scope of Kevin's employment -- any conduct violating policies of Enron or ENA -- Kevin's intentional acts -- Kevin's gross negligence -- Kevin's reckless conduct -- conduct that is in violation of any law statute regulation or other legal obligation or -- the commission of an unlawful or illegal act. 4. Kevin would invoice Enron for time spent in performing the services after 2/1/01. The invoice would be paid within 30 days of receipt. In addition all related expenses would be reimbursed throughout the term of the agreement. Let me know if you have any questions or require additional information.

Following discussions with the Prime Minister's office and a quick check with venues 31 October is firming up as the preferred date for a meeting with the Prime Minister and an office opening by the PM. Jeff Skilling Visit. The Nikkei and the Tokyo University have now made the decision to invite Mr Skilling to give the key note address at the symposium on 26 November in Tokyo. As mentioned the symposium is the most prestigious conference on IT in Japan. While the conference itself receives significant media attention the President of Nikkei has offered to interview Mr Skilling. This honour is usually reserved for Heads of State. The interview will be featured on the front page of the Nikkei and picked up by other major media services. kind regards Nicholas O'Day 08/29/2000 07:43 PM To: Steven J Kean/HOU/EES@EES Rosalee Fleming/Corp/Enron@ENRON cc: John Mark Schroeder/LON/ECT@ECT Joseph P Hirl/AP/ENRON@ENRON Mika Watanabe/AP/Enron Takashi Kimura/AP/Enron Subject: Re: Ken Lay meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Ken Lay Visit. Balancing the need to push out the arrangement of high level meetings as far as possible with the desire to have a meeting with Prime Minister Mori prior to the US Presidential election the week commencing 30 October would be the optimum time for a visit by Mr Lay. PM Mori is generally available in that week. We will get a preferred time from the PM's chief secretary first thing tomorrow morning Tokyo time. Jeff Skilling Visit. The boards of Nikkei and Tokyo University Institute of Advanced Studies have yet to make a decision on the key note speaker for the one day invitation only seminar to be held on 26 October. As mentioned the boards will choose between the chairman of Cisco and Jeff Skilling. The conference is focused on the IT revolution and an invitation only event for approximately 600 of Japan's corporate leaders. The speaking panel and topics for discussion will be developed around the key note speaker. If Mr Skilling were to give the key note speech it is likely that key senior Government Ministers would be asked to present at the seminar. Following the Prime Minister's commitment at the Okinawa summit of US$15billion expenditure in the region on IT infrastructure and education Japan's focus on e-commerce is almost reaching fever pitch. There will be significant interest in the conference from senior levels of Government and the business community. Further as you would expect with the involvement of the Nikkei there is typically significant media coverage associated with the key note speaker's presentation. kind regards,"Business; Japan; IT; Speeches

218,,attached is a copy of my california testimony. The proceeding was somewhat productive but turned into a witch hunt at a couple of points. Our view on this is: the problem is fairly straightforward (demand increases and new supplies are inhibited so prices go up and shortages ensue ... sound familiar?) and the solutions are straightforward (site the power plants suppliers are begging to build let the utilities hedge outside the exchange and finish the job of opening the interstate grid so power can get from where it is to where it is needed). What it comes down to at this point is FERC is the only entity with the authority to start fixing this problem now: Congress isn't going to get anything done this year and the California legislature is (thankfully) out of session now. Our political leaders need to give FERC the room they need to act. Good luck on your speech and give me a call sometime.,"Energy; FERC; California; Politics

What do you think about having Nels make the call to Lundquist just to find out what his status is what he might look for when his current assignment is over etc. (obviously without identifying us -- presumably Nels would have reason to talk to him anyway in the normal course of business)? I am not wedded to the idea but am inclined toward at least getting the information unless you see a problem. Linda Robertson 03/13/2001 02:16 PM To: Steven J Kean/NA/Enron@Enron Richard Shapiro/NA/Enron@Enron cc: Subject: Andrew Lundquist I got your message about Andrew. He would be an excellent catch. However I see a couple of significant problems. My guess is that Andrew is too senior for this position particularly after having chaired the Cheney task force. Also I would not anticipate that he would be available for several months if then. We should fill this position immediately. We are already missing opportunities because this position is vacant. As for our search using Korn Ferry I have narrowed the field to two very good candidates. I am setting up time for Rick to interview these candidates next Monday. The first candidate is Drew Maloney with Rep. Tom Delay's office. Drew would give us enormous visibility in House Republican leadership circles seems trustworthy and capable of learning most of the substance of the energy portfolio. Drew has strong networking skills which I think would nicely fit with Tom's strategic and technical skills. The second candidate is John Shelk whom I have known for nearly 15 years. John was the lead Republican staff on the House Energy and Commerce Committee under Norm Lent. John left the Committee in 1992. Since then John has worked in the financial services and gaming industries where he has enhanced his political and Republican networking skills. John in very short order would have extremely strong technical skills atlhough he has been away from the industry for eight years. I believe both candidates bring different but very strong talents to the job. I have a second opening for an enviromental advocate. I am discussing with Rick the possibility of whether we could redirect one of these candidates (probably John) to that slot. That said please let me know if I should have Nels pursue Andrew.,"Hiring; Energy; Politics

226,Re: news/updates,I am attaching the FERC order and staff recommendations. The order provides for $69 million in potential refunds (either pay up or provide cost justification). Enron was not named as one of the 13 overcharging parties but PGE was ($3.18 million). It's not over yet though. The order deals only with Jan 01 and promises further orders regarding Dec 00 and benchmark prices through April 01. The prices used to determine refunds were fairly high ($273/mwh based on gas prices emissions costs and an assumed heat rate of over 16000). With respect to sales to California we have concluded at least one short term sale and have talked with Cal Dept of Water Resources about longer term deals but we were still struggling with credit issues last I heard.

227,Re: Security Assessment Report,I appreciate you pressing this issue. You should both be aware that Unocal(?) has been sued by the families of four employees who were shot in Pakistan a couple of years ago. Their claim is that the company did not provide adequate security and ignored official warnings of trouble in the region. To: Gabriel cc: David Frank Shawn Elaine Bill Donovan/EPSC/HOU/ECT@ECT Melinda Winkler@ECT Steven J Kean/HOU/EES@EES Subject: Re: Security Assessment Report Gabriel et al: Looks like the risks to Enron travelers to (and employees in) Colombia have increased. This is another indication that a 'travel policy' for travelers to Colombia should be in effect. What happened to the one we were discussing earlier? The steps outlined there would go a long way in improving the security of our travelers. Control Risks' report discusses responses to the media - be sure you have the approval of Enron's media people before making any response. The report also recommends suspending bidding on new projects - probably not viable advice but reinforces the importance that additional security measures be built into all new projects from day one. Now that our name is in front of the Colombian public we could see retaliation for various acts not all of which we have control over. Recent US Government actions such as extraditing criminals to the US for trial and training Colombian anti-drug troops have done little to endear American businesses to the Colombian public who see such actions as interfering with Colombia's right to govern themselves. These actions have significantly raised the risk of all American companies and their employees in Colombia. A meeting I had about two years ago with David Beddow of Control Risks in Bogota indicated that we could see some changes in the methods of attack in urban areas by FARC/ELN. With an elevated risk level we should begin thinking about these threats. FARC seldom uses the car bomb method of attack because it generates little interest among the domestic or international media. FARC plans on using letter bombs mailed to select targets i.e. head of an American-owned corporation who may have an office in Bogota. This method will generate headlines in the press and generate a fear of FARC among businessmen who may be targets. Control Risks' reported timetable for this change in FARC's tactics was to be three to five years but now that our risk is higher the timetable may well be moved up. On a related note - did you employ the security person we recommended? Please let me know how I can help you.

228,Upcoming Advisory Council Meeting,I'm looking forward to your discussion regarding the reregulation threat at the next meeting. Below are some of my observations: While it's premature to say we have an energy crisis we are witnessing the triple threat of high summer gasoline prices spiking electricity prices and high natural gas prices for the upcoming heating season (I'll send along some of the data). There is at least the potential for this to become a prominent national political issue: Gore has focussed relentlessly on Bush's ties to big oil (which includes us by the way though we produce nary a drop) and Congressional republicans have blamed the current administration for failing to have a coherent energy policy (though at least so far the dominant characteristic of the administration's policy has been a republicanesque reliance on the market). Notwithstanding the issue's potential to become political fodder and its prominence in the popular press many Americans seem blissfully ignorant at least on the electricity issue. We did some focus group testing recently in Southern California -- a mere 15 minutes from the epicenter of the San Diego price quakes -- and most people knew nothing about it. So while the issue has the potential for political traction it may not have caught on yet (except in places like San Diego and New York city. The reaction in California has been to call for government intervention in electricity markets. Investigations of out of state price gougers and profiteers have been undertaken and wholesale and retail price caps have been put in place. They have not worked -- at least in wholesale markets. Suppliers are deciding to site plants elsewhere and when prices are high elsewhere in the West power flows out of California to those other markets. Ironically though I can't explain it in classical economic terms the setting of rate caps in wholesale markets has had the effect of pulling prices up to the capped levels in offpeak times when there is more than enough supply. For the most part though the caps and the other political reactions have been somewhat muted: policy makers have been reluctant to throw the deregulation plan out and start over and the retail price caps have been relatively narrow ... so far. Outside of California the authors of other states' deregulation plans have distinguished their proposals from California's. Regulators and legislators from such diverse places as Connecticut Texas and Alberta have gone out of their way to defend their plans and explain why California won't happen here. For the most part then the reaction to California has been positive from Enron's perspective in states that have already deregulated. There does remain some threat that aspects of the state plans (e.g. utility plant divestiture) may be postponed or cancelled. The story is a bit more grim in states that were considering deregulation but have not gone forward with their plans: I think it's off the agenda in most places. The fact that most of the major markets (about 70% of total electric revenue) are already deregulated/deregulating is a blessing in that regard. At the federal level there has been a combination of the burn the village in order to save it approach -- allow some price caps to remove the pressure to reverse the whole deregulation program -- and a more positive call for comprehensive reform. All in all I believe we're OK so far and we need to look at this as an opportunity: business is booming we sell protection from price volatility and the need for such protection is now plastered over the front pages of major newspapers. On the public policy front we need to convert the controversy into productive action. Our target has been FERC -- they are somewhat removed from the white hot rhetoric in California and they are a single commissioner's vote away from taking action to further open the market. Enron's response: Initially we hoped to feed information into industry groups and let them carry the message our concern was that Enron -- a company which was in and out of the residential market in Cal. -- would not make the most attractive champion for the open market message. We hoped that the new generators in Cal would take up the mantle. It's fair to say that they fumbled the ball: they are now locked in a pitched battle with the utilities over price caps and fall all to easily into the out of state profiteer label .... standing between Aunt Millie and rate relief. They were also extremely slow out of the blocks with a more productive message. We are now working the issue directly. We are working the issue on a number of levels: 1) PR - we have good contacts in the press and have talked to numerous reporters and editorial writers. As time goes on the information and reporting has gotten somewhat better. 2) Govt relations - we have been pushing for power plant siting legislation in California (the market wants to build capacity but the government won't let it). This may be the best environment we'll ever see for streamlining the permitting process. Also in typical Enron fashion we put a deal on the table. We offered to sell power to the local utility at a price which would enable them to lock in stable rates for their customers at below current rates. Our offer was followed by nine others and we tried to make something of the fact that the market was offering better solutions than California politicians. SDG&E dropped the ball unfortunately. Instead of seizing the opportunity they ended up going along with a government granted rate discount which will cause them to accrue a massive deferral account. At the federal level we are contacting members the DOE and FERC. Here we are making a push for FERC action to finish leveling the playing field in wholesale markets so power can get from where it is to where its needed. Additionally we are developing a prepackaged system (including software) for nondiscriminatory open access (to take away any lingering excuses or delays). 3) Overall messaging -- we have been working with a well known political pollster to check our messages for their resonance at the grassroots level. As we hone these messages we will be using them in the fora we are currently working. Overall we have more opportunity than risk in the current environment but capitalizing on those opportunities continues to be a long shot. An intersting rhetorical challenge for us is this: much of the problem in power markets is blamed on high upstream fuel prices particularly natural gas. The gas market is open and structured pretty much the way we are advocating for electricity so how can we maintain that the problem in power markets is an absence of open markets when the most open commodity market on the planet (natural gas) is producing such outsized prices? The answer is somewhat complicated and therefore a bit unsatisfactory in the current debate: gas prices are still lower in real terms than they were pre-deregulation long term prices are also lower than historical levels ( the curve is backwardated (sp?) meaning that prices in later years are lower than today so you can buy gas for 3 years at a price lower than current spot prices) and the economy is booming and driving up demand for basic inputs (this begs the question: why didn't the market react sooner and avoid the spike?). When all else fails a big part of the problem can be blamed on OPEC. We haven't had this thrown at us yet but we are trying to anticipate it and have answers at the ready. This is just the tip of the iceberg. The issue is a great example of the intersection of our business interests with public policy debates and should promote a lively discussion when we get together.

230,Re: CONFIDENTIAL - Residential in CA,I like the idea particularly if we can time any decision to turn the customers back so it falls after the failure to get some action out of Sacto (instead of after our earnings release). The only problem I see is that we would need a decision from the top that we're not going to turn the customers back if we get direct access (so we can end the debate). I don't think it helps us if we get lucky get direct access back then make a decision to return customers to the utility.

I strongly believe that the public hit we will take will be far greater than our actual out-of-pocket losses. We will be crucified by the public media consumer groups legislators governor attorney general etc. and this action will reaffirm our reputation of packing up and leaving when it's not in our interest. The impact of this action would be exacerbated since it is on the heels of UC/CSU. I would also argue that this hurts our national dereg efforts. If we're advocating that competition and choice benefits consumers and then we turn around and pull out of a market and abandon customers when we're not profiting we'll kill any chances we have of ever serving retail customers in California -- or in any other state. We look foolish advocating for direct access when we're not willing to serve our existing -- let alone future customers What about a preemptive strike that engages these 16000 customers to weigh in on direct access -- i.e. a letter that says Enron may be forced to cancel its contract -- call/write/send the enclosed postcard to your legislator and tell them you want to keep your right to choose your energy service provider. Our credibility is on the line. Before we take this action we need to be cognizant of all the long-range strategic implications and we need to seriously weigh the negative impact this will have on our corporate reputation on our legislative abilities and on our commercial success going forward. kd James D Steffes 04/12/2001 09:05 PM To: Jeff Dasovich/NA/Enron@Enron Paul Kaufman/PDX/ECT@ECT Sandra McCubbin/NA/Enron@Enron Richard Shapiro/NA/Enron@Enron Janel Guerrero/Corp/Enron@Enron Mark Palmer/Corp/Enron@ENRON Karen Denne/Corp/Enron@ENRON Susan J Mara/NA/Enron Peggy Mahoney/HOU/EES@EES Harry Kingerski/NA/Enron@Enron cc: Dan Leff/HOU/EES@EES Subject: CONFIDENTIAL - Residential in CA In the meeting today no decision was made about what to do with Enron's 16000 residential customers.

234,Re: USG overtures on Dabhol,Thanks for the update. From: John Hardy@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT on 05/10/2001 09:48 AM To: Rebecca McDonald/Enron@EnronXGate cc: Ben Glisan@ECT Steven J Kean/NA/Enron@Enron Rob Walls/ENRON@enronXgate Subject: USG overtures on Dabhol Rebecca At a meeting yesterday at OPIC on Trakya another of our problem projects Dabhol was raised. A representative from the White House transition team joined the conversation. I was asked the terms under which we were prepared to negotiate and I told them at a minimum upon a commitment by the Indian authorities to serious negotiations which would include full compliance with the terms of the contracts and progress in the reform of the MSEB. I made clear that we do not see the Godbole Committee as the basis for such a discussion. I think the USG wants to be on record politically encouraging the Indian Govt. to engage in discussions all parties consider to be meaningful in hopes of working things out before it is too late even while through OPIC and EXIM it is supporting the move towards PNT. The administration may be concerned that without such a diplomatic overture on its part it could be concluded that the USG has politically taken a position on the project. In Trakya for example the USG has been quite proactive in pressing the Turkish govt on the payments issue and even in discussing the payment concerns with the IMF so that the payments issues for the BOTs (two of the four in Turkey are US sponsored) are taken into account as the IMF program moves forward. So I anticipate that the USG will shortly be meeting with the Indian ambassador here and the US Charge in Delhiwill likely be directed to make the rounds and meet with senior government officals on the project. I wanted you to be aware of this also any guidance you can provide would be helpful. Thanks John,"Politics; US Government; India; Dabhol Power Project

235,Re: Job Titles and Job Banding,Thanks for your message. I do think we need to talk this through. In the meantime though let's not make anymore VPs until this is resolved. As I said in my original message I am not looking to undo what has been done but to make sure we don't do it again unless the process is followed. I understand that there are significant title differences across the regions we operate. In fact one of the people in my organization who did not make VP is Dennis Vegas who has done an extraordinary job in Latin America. Notwithstanding his regional focus (and the significance of a VP title in his region) he was put through the company wide process and he David Haug and I submit everyone else on the Exec Comm understood that every new VP would go through the same process regardless of regional assignment (with the exception of certain joint venture companies). But I maintain that we need some consistency in the VP title in particular -- i.e. that it remain an Enron-wide title granted only through the PRC process. Though I don't personally feel this way for many people in the organization the VP title means something separate from the compensation structure it implies something like making partner in a legal or consulting firm. Making that cut should not vary based on where you live or what region you support. I also understand the point about needing a certain title for external purposes. In my organization we are dealing with very title-conscious elected officials and media. I can make the case for every one of my directors and senior directors that they would be more effective externally if they carried a more senior title regardless of any change in compensation. As an executive committee we elected to make such an exception only for legacy title holders -- i.e. people who had previously made VP outside the process. Everyone in my organization To: Cindy Olson@ENRON Steven J Kean@EES cc: Sanjay Subject: Job Titles and Job Banding From reading the e-mails on the issue regarding Regional Vice President at Enron India it sounds like there will be more discussion on this issue. I know that issues like this generally come up at the Enron ExCom level. There are a few issues that need to be kept in mind and although Cindy and I have discussed these in the past I have not had an opportunity to pursue them further (but would be happy to help out on this). I have noticed these not only in India but also in the other international settings where I have worked for Enron during the past several years. 1. International job titles and domestic job titles do not correlate. For example in India the title Director implies a very senior person within the organization (well above VP) whereas in the Enron domestic world it is a position below VP. Managing Director within Enron is below the most senior levels but in India a MD is the Ken Lay equivalent. For this reason I cannot use Managing Director in my title or on my business card although this is my title for Enron Houston purposes. 2. Job titles are much more important in an international setting than in a domestic setting. For example in Houston we have people at the director (and probably manager) level who lead deal teams and bring deals to successful closing. In an international setting particularly India to get to the decision-makers in your counterpart organization an officer title of VP or above is very often required. To a certain degree this is form over substance but that's what works over here. 3. To solve some of these problems Enron should consider doing what some other international companies have done (and I think Cindy and her team may already be working on this). A job banding study should be done and based on responsibilities everyone globally should be placed in a band. It would not be a title band of VP or director or manager but rather a band with a non-title classification. I hate to suggest a band with numbers such as 1 through 15 because that sounds way too much like the government but something like that would work. Once this is done communication is made to employees that the band is what is key in determining their compensation and level within the organization. Then the business units can rely on their particular market dynamics or on what their competition is doing to determine job titles. Thus if the Global Origination group needs to have a title of Senior Trader and EECC needs a title of Project Leader and Enron India needs a Regional Vice President all can be accomplished while keeping these same people at a consistent level for global Enron purposes. I will be happy to discuss this further with any of you. Plus I will volunteer to participate in finding a solution that works for all of Enron while taking into account the specifc business unit and/or global function needs.

Stephen D Burns@ENRON 07/19/2000 01:47 AM To: Richard Shapiro/HOU/EES@EES James D Steffes/HOU/EES@EES cc: Scott Bolton/Enron Communications@Enron Communications Joe Hillings/Corp/Enron@ENRON Chris Long/Corp/Enron@ENRON (bcc: Steven J Kean/HOU/EES) Subject: BLM/Forest Service Right-of-Way Update The Senate voted on the Interior Appropriations Bill late yesterday. Our amendment passed which prevents either BLM or the Forest Service from enacting new fiber optic federal lands rights-of-way policies. The BLM made a last ditch effort to defeat this in the Senate but we had reached key Senators and staff and they got nowhere. Action now moves to Conference which for us means a focus on the House Conference members. Scott and I will spend the next 2 days meeting with the key Republicans in the House. We've already recruited the important Democrats. Interior Approps Subcommittee Chairman Regula remains opposed at least publicly but we think we can get other Members to swing him. We trust he'll come up with a sensible face saving compromise on his own eg formally beginning a review process with his Subcommittee having oversight -- at this point our language literally forbids BLM or Forest Service from even meeting to discuss the issue. We continue though on several other fronts: 1. We have the New Dems writing OMB on the issue and several Senators and Congressmen writing BLM and USFS 2. We've increased the pressure on the White House and are letting them know through very senior back door channels that in our opinion BLM/Forest Service have not gotten the message. Our position is that we'll be satisfied that they've changed their evil ways when the new assessment on the Mt. Hood EBS build is retracted. 3. We're preparing both Senate and House authorizing Committees for the longer-term issue next session. We have no trouble finding champtions eager to own the issue 4. We're engaging the Western Caucus for same 5. Our adhoc coalition continues to grow in numbers and clout with over 20 companies and associations now actively engaged. Enron chairs this initiative with a tangible side benefit being much increased visibility and stature as a serious communications player. 6. Scott is successfully engaging state and local officials to weigh in from the end-user perspective BLM is on the retreat and has asked for a meeting which we've refused. We don't think they've given up though and it's likely an issue of pride at this point. So until the Approps process concludes we're continuing with the full court press.

Twice in the last three months I have run into the Chairman of AGA who has taken my head off for Enron not renewing its AGA dues. I understand that the dues had been paid by Stan Horton who had decided that the pipeline group with INGAA representing it had no need for and received no benefit from the membership. I guess a few years back when AGA kicked the pipelines out they renegotiated the dues into some type of sub membership for around 85K. AGA approached the gas marketing team and talked to Mike Roberts about renewing the membership and maintaining relations with his customers and later to Jeff Shankman who passed them off to some other person and never got back to them as promised. This is a heads up to tell you that Bob Catell of Brooklyn Union fame- one of Enron's oldest customers and friends will be calling Lay. It seems to me that pro rating the dues among ENA and EGM and maybe GPG might be a solution. Anyhow I promised to pass on the complaint. Thanks.,"AGA; Dues; Customers; Enron

275,,BY MARK GOLDEN A DOW JONES NEWSWIRES COLUMN NEW YORK (DOW JONES)--THE CALIFORNIA SENATE IN SACRAMENTO PASSED A WINDFALL-PROFITS TAX ON SALES OF ELECTRICITY INTO THE STATE'S WHOLESALE ELECTRICITY MARKET MONDAY AFTERNOON AT 4:50 P.M. PDT. AT ALMOST EXACTLY THE SAME TIME CALIFORNIA INDEPENDENT SYSTEM OPERATOR INITIATED ROLLING BLACKOUTS FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE MARCH. COINCIDENCE? PROBABLY BUT THE CONNECTION SHOULDN'T BE IGNORED. THE POLICY DECISIONS THAT HAVE BEEN ADOPTED IN CALIFORNIA TO DATE HAVE ACCELERATED AN ALREADY SERIOUS MARKET COLLAPSE SAID A HARVARD UNIVERSITY STUDY OF CALIFORNIA'S ENERGY CRISIS LATE LAST MONTH. THIS WEEK'S WINDFALL-PROFITS TAX BILL IS THE LATEST BLUNT INSTRUMENT WIELDED WITH POTENTIALLY DISASTROUS RESULTS. GOV. GRAY DAVIS WANTED IT AS A STICK WHEN (CONT) MEETING WITH EXECUTIVES FROM THE STATE'S MERCHANT POWER COMPANIES WEDNESDAY. THE MANEUVER WAS LESS THAN ADROIT AND THE GENERATORS WEREN'T IMPRESSED. AFTER THE MEETING WITH DAVIS RELIANT ENERGY'S (REI) JOHN STOUT SAID THAT IF THE TAX WERE IMPLEMENTED IN CALIFORNIA IT WOULD INSTANTLY BLACK OUT ALL THE GENERATION IN THE STATE. THE STATE'S LEADERS MIGHT KEEP IN MIND WHO WIELDS THE BIGGER STICK AT THIS POINT. CALIFORNIA SET UP A MARKET IN WHICH SELLERS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CHARGE VERY HIGH PRICES FOR ELECTRICITY SINCE SUPPLIES STARTED GETTING TIGHT A YEAR AGO. SELLERS SAY THEY HAVE PLAYED BY THE RULES THEY WERE GIVEN AND NOBODY HAS PROVED OTHERWISE WITH THE ONE EXCEPTION OF A FINE PAID BY WILLIAMS COMPANIES (WMB) FOR ONE PARTICULAR INSTANCE OF VIOLATING A CONTRACT. IT'S LIKE SOMEBODY INVENTED A NEW GAME INVITED YOU OVER TO PLAY AND THEN CHANGED THE RULES A COUPLE OF TIMES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE GAME. THEN AFTER YOU BEAT THEM THEY INSIST YOU CHEATED SAID ONE WESTERN ENERGY TRADER. ALMOST EVERY ATTEMPT BY THE BUY SIDE - THE UTILITIES THE ISO AND NOW THE (CONT) STATE TREASURY - TO LOWER PRICES HAS RESULTED IN HIGHER PRICES OR BLACKOUTS OR BOTH. THE WINDFALL-PROFITS TAX IDEA IS THE MOST RECENT EXAMPLE BUT THOSE WHO INSIST ON PRICE CAPS SHOULD KEEP THIS IN MIND: THE ISO HAS HAD PRICE CAPS SINCE IT BEGAN OPERATION MORE THAN THREE YEARS AGO. OBVIOUSLY PRICE CAPS HAVEN'T WORKED JUST AS THEY HAVE NEVER WORKED EXCEPT DURING WARTIME. IN FACT PRICE CAPS HAVE BEEN A QUESTIONABLE MEDICINE PRESCRIBED FOR THE WRONG DISEASE. AT BEST PRICE CAPS MIGHT RESTRICT PRICE SPIKES. CALIFORNIA'S PROBLEM IS PERPETUAL HIGH PRICES. IT CAN'T AFFORD THE GOING RATE AT NIGHTTIME LET ALONE THE HIGHER MARKET PRICES DURING THE AFTERNOONS IN A HEATWAVE. CALIFORNIA MUST FIGURE OUT HOW TO PLAY BETTER THE GAME IT INVENTED. THE INSANELY COMPLICATED COMPUTER-BASED PURCHASING OF POWER ENDED A FEW MONTHS AGO AFTER THE CALIFORNIA POWER EXCHANGE WAS CLOSED DOWN BY FEDERAL REGULATORS AND THE ISO LOST ITS FINANCIAL ABILITY TO BUY POWER. THE MATCH BETWEEN THE PROGRAMS AND THE ENERGY TRADERS WASN'T EXACTLY IBM'S BIG BLUE VERSUS GARRY KASPAROV. ALMOST EVERYONE IN THE MARKET AGREES THAT THE UTILITIES' HUMAN TRADERS COULD (CONT) HAVE BOUGHT NEEDED POWER FOR BILLIONS OF DOLLARS LESS THAN THE PROGRAMS THAT THE UTILITIES WERE REQUIRED TO USE BY STATE LAW. SINCE THE DEMISE OF PROGRAMMED PURCHASING THE COMPUTERS HAVE BEEN REPLACED BY HUMANS BUT WITHOUT MUCH BETTER RESULTS. THE TEAM ASSEMBLED TO BUY TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS WORTH OF SPOT POWER EVERY DAY CONSISTS MOSTLY OF FORMER EMPLOYEES OF THE POWER EXCHANGE AND ISO AS WELL AS EXPENSIVE CONSULTANTS WITH NO ENERGY TRADING EXPERIENCE. ONE OF THE LEADERS OF THE TRADING TEAM FOR EXAMPLE IS A FORMER PUBLIC RELATIONS DIRECTOR FOR THE POWER EXCHANGE WITH NO TRADING EXPERIENCE PRIOR TO THE CURRENT JOB. AS ONE ISO EMPLOYEE WAS WONT TO SAY: IT'S LIKE WATCHING A FOOTBALL GAME BETWEEN NOTRE DAME AND ST. MARY'S SCHOOL FOR UNWED MOTHERS. AND THE SIGNING OF TENS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF FIVE- AND 10-YEAR CONTRACTS IS BEING EXECUTED MAINLY BY FORMER EXECUTIVES OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON - PEOPLE THAT LEFT THE UTILITY YEARS AGO TO BECOME CONSULTANTS AND ALSO DON'T HAVE TRADING EXPERIENCE. GOOD IDEAS MEANWHILE HAVE LANGUISHED. (CONT) WE ARE GOING TO INSTALL METERS IN EVERY MAJOR COMMERCIAL CONCERN IN THE STATE THIS SUMMER AND GO TO REAL-TIME PRICING DAVIS TOLD WALL STREET ANALYSTS ON FEB. 28. THAT PROPOSAL WAS GREETED BY MANY OBSERVERS AS THE MOST CONSTRUCTIVE IDEA FROM THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE TO DATE. WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO REAL-TIME PRICING FOR CALIFORNIA'S BIG BUSINESSES SINCE THEN? NOTHING. THE PROBLEM IS THAT EVERYBODY IN CALIFORNIA IS 'SPECIAL' SAID STANFORD ECONOMIST AND CALIFORNIA ISO CONSULTANT FRANK WOLAK. EVERY INDUSTRY FROM OIL REFINERS TO INTERNET SERVER FARMS HAS HAD LOBBYISTS IN SACRAMENTO SUCCESSFULLY SECURING EXCEPTIONS TO THE RULE. MY POINT HAS BEEN THAT IF WHAT THEY DO IS SO VALUABLE THEN THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO HANDLE THE HIGHER PRICES. BUSINESSES WITH ABOUT 10000 MEGAWATTS OF LOAD HAVE REAL-TIME METERS. EVERY ONE OF THEM SHOULD BE GETTING MARKET PRICES SAID WOLAK. (CONT) ONE OF THE GREATEST ADVANTAGES THAT SELLERS OF ELECTRICITY TO CALIFORNIA HAVE HAD IS THAT CONSUMERS HAVE FIXED PRICES SO DEMAND IS INFLEXIBLE. SELLERS KNOW EXACTLY HOW MUCH ELECTRICITY THE UTILITIES MUST BUY BASED ON TEMPERATURES AND THE TIME OF DAY WOLAK SAYS AND THEY SIMPLY SUPPLY THE MARKET JUST ENOUGH POWER AT HIGH MARGINAL PRICES. REDUCING OVERALL CONSUMPTION THROUGH HIGHER RATES WILL HELP THE STATE SOME BUT MAKING 25% OF DEMAND FLEXIBLE BASED ON PRICE WOULD GIVE THE STATE A FIGHTING CHANCE IN THE MARKET ACCORDING TO WOLAK. BUT THAT APPARENTLY IS TOO COMPLICATED OR POLITICALLY DIFFICULT. PRICE CAPS A WINDFALL-PROFITS TAX AND POLITICAL PATRONAGE JOBS FOR BUYING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF POWER MAY NOT SAVE THE STATE FROM BANKRUPTCY BUT THEY ARE EASIER TO SELL - OR SLIP THROUGH - IN SACRAMENTO. -BY MARK GOLDEN DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 201-938-4604 MARK.GOLDEN@DOWJONES.COM,"Energy; California; Politics; Economy

288,,FYI. From today's Post. Davis seems to continue to put distance between himself and the contracts. Best Jeff Financial California Changes Stance on Refunds Two Sides Far Apart In Energy Talks Peter Behr 07/06/2001 The Washington Post FINAL Page E01 Copyright 2001 The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved California officials have abruptly shifted tactics in their attempt to recover billions of dollars in alleged overcharges for electricity  saying they may reduce their demands for huge refunds if generators renegotiate $43 billion in long-term electricity contracts that the state signed this year. Gov. Gray Davis (D) said part of the $8.9 billion in refunds the state is seeking could be offset by reductions in energy prices in the long-term contracts whose costs have become a growing political embarrassment for Davis. We've made suggestions we've offered various ways in which people could get us $8.9 billion Davis told the San Jose Mercury News in a report yesterday. You can renegotiate our existing contracts and save us money. However you want to do it it's just got to net out close to $8.9 billion. The new offer was introduced this week into the closed negotiations over a California settlement being conducted in Washington by Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Judge Curtis L. Wagner Jr. according to sources close to the negotiations. Yesterday Wagner said he may issue his own preliminary finding today on the amount of overcharges if California officials and the generators cannot reach a compromise. What I'm trying to do is get people in a settlement mood Wagner told reporters. In the event we're unable to do that [Friday] at some point I may offer a preliminary assessment. The settlement conference is set to conclude on Monday. Wagner FERC's chief administrative judge has been trying to push both sides toward a compromise that would resolve the huge energy pricing controversy. Mountainous energy prices have bankrupted California 's largest utility drained billions of dollars out of the state treasury and put Davis at sword's point with generators that help keep the state's lights on. Last Friday Wagner rebuked Davis's chief representative Michael Kahn chairman of California Independent Grid Operator -- the state's power grid manager -- indicating that the state's demand for nearly $9 billion in refunds from power generators and marketers was too high sources said. Wagner's settlement conference which has involved more than 100 lawyers for all sides is closed to the public and media. Wagner complained last month that Kahn was following a political agenda and his lack of independence in the negotiations was such a joke that the parties might as well wear clown suits according to a Dow Jones report confirmed by sources close to the talks. But he has also criticized the generators and power marketers led by Reliant Energy Inc. Williams Energy Services Duke Energy and Southern Co. for failing to make serious settlement offers these sources said. The suppliers have offered to refund $600 million provided the state is able to call off various California lawsuits demanding far larger refunds sources said. Wagner's leverage is his ability to propose his own refund figure to FERC's commissioners. FERC has tentatively called for $124 million in refunds but now is taking a harder line on preventing a new escalation of California 's electricity prices this summer and is likely to be receptive to a higher refund figure some energy analysts believe. Davis's tactical change offering to make the long-term contracts part of an overall settlement comes amid growing criticism of what the state will have to pay for energy under those deals. California 's energy calamity stemmed in large part from its failed deregulation plan which relied heavily on short-term power purchases at volatile spot market prices. When energy costs shot upward last summer so did the state's electricity bills. In response Davis's aide S. David Freeman and his staff began negotiating long-term power contacts with suppliers. The $43 billion in deals signed so far would require the state to pay about $70 per hour for a megawatt of power for a large part of the electricity it will need over the next 10 years. That's well under the average of $250 per megawatt-hour that the state was paying at the beginning of this year but above current power prices -- and considerably higher than what electricity may cost in the next decade energy analysts say. A new agreement to lower those contract prices could relieve political pressure on Davis and focus settlement negotiations away from the state's controversial demand for the $8.9 billion refund. Davis will argue that reducing future power charges that his administration negotiated should count as a refund because the deals were reached under commercial duress according to sources close to Wagner's negotiations. Industry supporters say Davis's refund figure is impossible to justify. There's no benchmark for what a fair and reasonable price should be said Michael Zenger California director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates. The state's advocates counter that if FERC enforced a just and reasonable standard for power prices based on operating costs and a generous profit the overcharges by all sellers could easily reach the $9 billion figure. It's not rocket science but it does require the regulators to regulate said Frank Wolak a Stanford University economist who heads an oversight committee for the California grid. Those polar-opposite views have left both sides in Wagner's conference room billions of dollars apart as the talks approached their final weekend sources said.,"Energy; California; Politics; Refunds; Negotiations

292,Report On EPSA Legislative Affairs Committee Meeting,The EPSA leg. affairs cmt. met today during the fall meeting. The speakers were Howard Useem Republican counsel to the Senate Energy Committee and Jimmy Glotfelty senior policy advisory to the Secretary of Energy. Useem said Senate Energy Committee Republicans were meeting later this morning to finalize their energy proposal. (We later learned that they opted against including any electricity provisions not even the PURPA PUHCA and reliability issues that Howard thought might be included when he spoke before the senators met this is good news since it makes it less likely that anti-FERC provisions will be added.) (Howard said now is the best time to legislative on electricity because the Supreme Court has not yet acted on the bundling/unbundling issue.) On RTOs in some what of a surprise Useem said that there is general support among Senate Republicans for RTOs including consolidating them into a few RTOs of large scope (surprising since this is not what we have heard in meetings with individual Senate offices). While he said that he also said that support is stronger in the abstract than in specifics. He said the biggest opposition was coming from very vocal state regulators (EPSA staff did a good job of pointing to state regulators mainly in the Midwest who support larger RTOs). Most importantly Howard said none of the senators on his committee take a not over my dead body approach to RTOs. Jimmy Glotfelty explained to several EPSA members who asked questions just why it is that the Administration wants Congress to be silent on RTOs. He said while they would prefer a sentence or two affirming FERC's authority they do not believe this is what would come out of the legislative process. They are not willing to run that risk. He stressed that the president wants to include other electricity issues. He said they were very close to an agreement with Western governors on regional transmission siting. Jimmy further said that the Administration also wants silence on incentive rates another issue where FERC can act now. They continue to talk to Barton and his staff in an attempt to get them to back away from the restrictive approach to RTOs in the Barton discussion draft. (He said Pat Wood spent several hours with Barton and other House committee staff yesterday.) Of concern Jimmy said something like could be 4 RTOs could be 8 RTOs what is important is getting standard design. He also said DOE will make sure that PMAs are included in RTOs.,"Energy; Legislation; RTOs; FERC; Senate Energy Committee

This week has been very quiet on Capitol Hill as all of the members are back in the states on August recess running for re-election and it is a big vacation week for staff...but here's what I am hearing: As you may or may not know we have been been very active this year trying to temper pipeline safety legislation that was fairly reactionary in the wake of last summer's liquid pipeline accident in Bellingham WA. SENATE: In June Senators John McCain (R-AZ) and Slade Gorton (R-WA) led the charge to pass a pipeline safety bill (S. 2438) out of the Senate Commerce Committee and that bill is awaiting floor action in the Senate. Because of the hasty way in which S. 2438 was drafted and passed there was a realization by both Republicans and Democrats in the Senate that the bill could not make it to the floor for a vote until some serious changes were made -- mostly things that were deal breakers for industry. Enron and El Paso were leading the charge and we had a number of Senators backing our efforts to negotiate changes including Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-MS) Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) John Breaux (D-LA) and Sam Brownback (R-KS). From what I've learned since the accident these Senators are not changing their strategy and are still asking for the same improvements. Fortunately most of the changes we were looking to make were fairly technical and not the types of things that would be seriously compromised by the accident. Industy was already in the position of having to accept a number of things they never would have if not for he Bellingham incident...the El Paso incident just reinforces those. The biggest potential effect I see from the El Paso accident is an increased effort to pass something before the Congress adjourns in early October. The New Mexico Senators are already calling for a floor vote on the McCain/Gorton legislation and I there will certainly be greater pressure on leaders to wrap up negotiations get agreement from all sides on a bill and move it unanimously through a vote on the Senate floor. HOUSE: The House is moving a bit more slowly but again I'd expect the El Paso situation to expedite things somewhat. There were several bills introduced in the House that were not moving anywhere including an identical copy of the McCain legislation introduced by Rep. Bob Franks (R-NJ). Franks is now anxious to move legislation as he is running for Senate and would love to take credit for helping out on an issue of national visibility. Before the accident House Tranportation Committee leaders on both the Democrat and Republican side were working on a consensus bill that they could introduce in early September and move quickly through the Committee and to the House floor. I'm told that negotiations on that legislation are moving forward and a draft bill will be produced shortly. Unlike our experience in the Senate we have had significant input into the bill in advance and expect something that we can live with -- and something more reasonable than the McCain bill. With that said there may be an effort to expand the bill in a few areas because of the El Paso accident so we'll have to see what kind of hand we're dealt in the next few weeks. Overall I'd expect pipeline safety legislation to be given higher priority when Congress returns after Labor Day. In the absence of this accident I would have given it slim odds of passing in the few short weeks until adjournment with appropriations bills taking up most of Congress' precious time. Now there will be greater pressure to come to consensus and move bills through by an expedited process so that everyone running for election in November can show that they've done something about this terrible tragedy. With that said there's still not that much time to get legislation through so I'd say that there's still a chance it may not get done this year. If I had to attach a number to it I'd say that the El Paso accident improves the chances of legislation going all the way to probably 50-60%. 2) Gas supply to California: I'll have to do some more checking in this area and get back to you. All I've heard so far is that the safety questions that remain may slow the speed of restarting flow on the line notwithstanding that El Paso thinks it can have things running again fairly quickly. I'm sure the power crunch in California will put some counter-pressure on but I just don't have good intelligence on this yet.

We would love to get some input from your group on the following questions if possible: 1. What is the status of pipeline safety legislation on the Hill and what is the outlook for action between now and the end of the year? 2. What are people from California saying about the added pressure on gas supplies and what are people from New Mexico saying about restarting the flow of gas while safety questions remain? These questions come straight from the top and any information you could provide would be very helpful. Please write me back or call and let me know if/when you think we might be able to get some initial answers. Thanks very much! Clay,"Pipeline safety; Legislation; Gas supply; California; New Mexico

302,Re: Daily Update / Legislative Update - 8/23/00,It's hard to formulate a position without more of the specifics but I think our message should generally be: We support providing immediate rate relief to small residential customers. We believe that relief is best provided by giving San Diego the ability to procure power on a fixed price basis from the market. San Diego has offers in front of it now those should be evaluated and the legislature and the commission should give San Diego the flexibility to accept one or more of them. This is sounder than running huge deferrals (deficits) to be later recovered from consumers. Rate relief should be accompanied by real reform. Rate caps have bad long term consequences: they cause shortages. Combining short-medium term rate relief with expedited siting of new facilities will address the near term problem while laying the proper groundwork for a long term solution.

306,Re: request to CERA,Your understanding was correct. In light of recent changes in the California regulatory environment (eg the recent rate order) I don't think it makes sense for us to distribute the document at this time so you can ignore the request. Thanks Peter Augustini <paugustini@CERA.com> 03/29/2001 06:18 PM To: 'skean@enron.com' <skean@enron.com> cc: David Gibbons <dgibbons@CERA.com> Subject: request to CERA Steve: Thanks for your note sorry I missed you. From your message I think there may be some miscommunication between your PR guys and us. We understood that your PR people wanted to reprint the Op-ed and redistribute it to as-yet-undetermined people along with various Enron material. They also wanted to post it on Enron's public web site. But your message seemed to indicate you just want to post the op-ed on your intranet - for educational use only for your internal folks. If this is correct we would have no problem with it. In fact we have posted the op-ed on the CERA web page - which is theoretically available to every Enron employee for internal use only. If you want you could just post a link to the CERA web site so your people could get direct access to all our research on the topic. If I misunderstood you and you do want to redistribute the piece to third-parties -- that is a much bigger issue because it involves our intellectual property and branding issues. Obviously we would need to talk some more about this. I hope this helps. On a somewhat-related note we are also getting sucked more and more into the California vortex and being asked to help in areas that are not our traditional business such as expert witness testimony and policy issues. While we are not afraid to take a point of view (as you know!) we must maintain a neutral and independent posture. This is sometimes a difficult path to navigate but we are exploring two areas that may also interest Enron: 1. We have examined Joskow and FERC's analysis on the price gouging issue and we believe there are several major flaws in their methodologies. We are considering how best to broadcast our assessment without impinging on our core business or becoming an expert witness. We think a workshop similar to the Monday event at CERAWeek could work where we would present our findings and issue a report. 2. We are also looking into the economic impact of power outages in the West - especially linked to the overall fragile state of the US economy. This would be a collaborative effort with a major economic forecasting firm or university. Again the reults would go to our clients but could be released to a wider audience and a workshop might help highlight the release. Please let us know if either topic would be of interest to Enron. We would need to raise funding from various clients to help underwrite the effort  but the work would be CERA's independent research and we would stand fully behind it. Hope all is well. ...Peter .,"Energy; Regulation; California; CERA; Enron

The intranet site will be placed on the home.enron.com webpage by Tuesday morning for all Enron employees to access. However today this comprehensive database is available to you for your California Power Issue needs. The database has been populated with the latest information that I have received concerning this topic and has been broken down in three categories: California Power Issues National Power Issues and Secured Documents. It has then been broken down further into subcategories. The secured documents sections will only be accessible to those that are receiving this e-mail. Please let me know if you believe others should have access to this information. The secured document section contains all the information that I have received that Luntz Consulting has helped us develop i.e. principals statements speeches and facts as well as talking points and other statements developed internally. These documents can be easily switched to open access to all Enron employees if you believe that these documents should not be restricted. To access the intranet site you must be logged on to the network and then go to this link: (It is best if you copy this link and paste it in your internet Explorer or Netscape browser.) Once you are at this site you will be able to access all articles and information that I have collected/received concerning the California Power Issue. You can navigate the site by using the links on the left hand side of the screen. While navigating this site keep in mind that the actual interface will be changed before we go live on Tuesday morning. To access the secured documents click on secured documents and type in your user name which is the same as if you are logging onto the network and then type in your password which is the same as if you are logging onto the network. However if you have difficulties entering this site you will need to change your Lotus internet password. Which is very simple to do and which you will need to do regardless if you decide to use this site or not it is all part of the current computer migration. To change your internet password go to this link and then hit the edit person key. Go to the last field that says internet password and type in whatever password you would like preferably your current network login password. (In the internet password section you will see a bunch of numbers and letters delete those and enter your new network password.) There are still some bugs that will be worked out by Tuesday but I thought since this is such a fast moving issue it was best to get this tool out so it could be used when needed.

Non-affiliated competitors continue to build straw men and describe abuses with no real evidence to back them up (the funny money argument and capacity hoarding are two examples. The funny money argument assumes marketing affiliates will bid above market rates for capacity because they excess payment is going to the corporate bottom line. Hoarding capacity to drive up price may be an issue but it is not a marketing affiliate issue as anyone can do it). FERC staff did not seem terribly sympathetic to the points made but at least one FERC staffer seemed to believe that one solution would be to require the pipelines to offer capacity in smaller blocks to let smaller entities put together bids. FERC also indicated they were in fact auditing compliance but in a non-public way. There were some concerns voiced which I agree with and there is an opportunity to file additional comments on Apr. 30. I would like to put the following in these comments: Evidence of affiliate abuse/preference is just not there. The best folks can do is make up stuff. We welcome FERC monitoring if that is needed to bring confidence to the marketplace that abuse is not occurring. But the issue is really whether we do have a crisis of confidence or merely a bunch of disgruntled competitors who are just seeking to neutralize the affiliated competitors). The FERC rules and the information reported (with a caveat) under those rules are adequate for detection and enforcement and deterrence. That said the definition of marketing affiliate should be expanded to include affiliated electric generators who are siting plants along affiliate pipelines. The pipeline 637 reporting and internet systems should allow users to download and manipulate transportation related data which is not currently the case. We also need to address a deal on Northern where ENA took capacity at a discount albeit after other parties had an opportunity to match our bid. This was a deal brought up in the conference. Let me know how this sounds. Thanks.,"FERC; Marketing; Conferences; Energy; Regulation

Ed asked that we not circulate these to anyone. Ed asked us to give him feedback of any concerns we have with the talking points (he will be giving them comments). After glancing at the TPs the obvious missing point is open access. However I am not sure we should be alarmed about that. There really isn't any policy in the TPs. This is a typical WH message document. Let me know if you think it is imperative to insert open access. Also Ed would like to position us as the coalition leader of the White House outreach effort. Any thoughts? 2. I am faxing to you EPSA's summary of the generators meeting with Secretary Abraham. I am glad I did not attend this meeting.

Mr. Skilling's office is hesitant to allocate more than two hours without your recommendation. Emerson is being persistent. The key players from Emerson are David Farr newly appointed CEO and James Berges President and effectively the leader of Emerson's strategic development effort. It is anticipated that both would attend the meeting. Emerson execs want to (i) get to know Mr. Skilling and other senior management (ii) discuss mutual business opportunities and (iii) hold a discussion about the transformation of Enron from a pipeline company to its current form. The last point has to do with Emerson's continuing self-transformation effort and how Enron achieved its transformation. I need your advice and recommendation. Please respond by e-mail or telephone (x5-4040). Background: Emerson initiated this latest round of contact with Enron in November 2000 when Mike Train and Mark Proudfoot both Emerson VPs of Corporate Development visited the Enron building hosted by Steve Kean. I met them at that time. Since that initial meeting Emerson has aggressively pursued a business joint venture as preferred supplier with Martin Wenzel and the distributed power business I believe with promising results. My sense is that Emerson is uniquely positioned as EES' partner in that business. I am waiting to receive an update from Martin. Emerson is also interested in becoming a preferred supplier for EES's DSM business. While we generally support that idea we are pressing Emerson to reciprocate by becoming a customer of our bundled outsource business. Emerson is highly decentralized and our efforts to date have been unsuccessful. I want to use the meeting as an opportunity to press Emerson to consider a proposal from EES's bundled outsource business. Please let me know your recommendation on this matter.

Recently Chris Calger has asked me to set up a meeting with Sempra. ENA's seeking deals with the two big CA gas IOUs (PG&E and SoCalGas) that would give ENA access to their assets. In short ENA wants to offer a complete outsource deal for the IOUs' core gas load (i.e. rez and small commercial customers). ENA would take responsibility for providing service for delivery at the city gate and in return would manage all of core's assets (upstream of the city gate). We're meeting with Sempra's Chief Regulatory Office (Bill Reed) and Sempra's CFO next Thursday to discuss. Given the fact that Sempra's primarily focused on electricity the plan is to lead off the meeting with a couple of electricity solutions as a bridge to the gas offer. For electricity the plan has two pieces: 1) a commodity offer that beats the 6.5 cent cap (i.e. nothing fancy) and 2) Deal Bench services with the intent of establishing a procurement mechanism for SDG&E that the California PUC could pre-approve (thereby eliminating some of the immense regulatory risk SDG&E now faces). Wanted to run this by folks to gauge reactions. We'll distribute the slides we're putting together as soon as they're drafted--hopefully by COB Friday. Best Jeff,"Energy; Meetings; Enron; Sempra

329,,Ken Lay spoke with several California CEOs this morning and urged them to get personally involved in pushing for a comprehensive set of reforms. Three expressed willingness to help. Scott McNealy (Sun): contact person - Piper Cole (piper.cole@sun.com) scott.mcnealy@engeng.sun.com. Mcnealy wants by close of business today a cheat sheet of the talking points to use with politicians (the 8 or 10 elements of the solution) with the expected comeback he may hear from the political leaders and our response to that comeback. He says he hasn't spent time working on issues in Sacremento so we may also want to include a list of suggested contacts. Kevin Sharer (Amgen): contact person - Sarah Jensen VP of Engineering and Operations (805.447.6785) ksharer@amgen.com. Sharer wants the same information as McNealy and he and McNealy both indicated their willingness to call a meeting of other California CEOs. Sharer will also be having breakfast with Hertzberg one week from today. Robert Day (Trust Co of the West): said that he is very close to the mayor of Los Angeles.

330,DRAFT Comments on Barton RTO Draft,Attached for review and comment is a draft set of talking points on the Barton RTO discussion draft. I went through the testimony at the recent hearing and parsed the legislative language of the discussion draft. You will see that the talking points are designed to respond to two basic points being raised by our opponents: (1) that FERC is rushing and being heavy-handed and (2) that the only interests involved are those of the transmitting utilities (i.e. no mention of discrimination as being what RTOs will remedy). Please let me have your thoughts in the next few days. Once Capitol Hill is up and running again we will distribute the final talking points to our consultants and to members/staff of the Barton Subcommittee as we continue our efforts against the discussion draft's treatment of RTOs.,"Energy Policy; FERC; RTOs

Donnelly could lead to a= =20 mass exodus by hundreds of small energy producers that have been selling=20 power to the state's financially troubled utilities for months without=20 getting paid. ?????At the same time it may have staved off plans by a group of the small= =20 generators to send Edison into involuntary bankruptcy as early as today. ?????In Sacramento energy legislation pushed by Gov. Gray Davis passed in= =20 the state Senate but foundered in the Assembly. The measure was intended to= =20 ensure that the state gets repaid for the electricity that it has been buyi= ng=20 on behalf of Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric which say they lack the cas= h=20 and credit to purchase power. The bill also was supposed to guarantee that= =20 the small alternative energy producers--which together provide nearly a=20 third of the state's power--get paid. But Assembly Republicans opposed it= =20 saying it hadn't been given sufficient scrutiny. ?????The impact of the small producers was made clear in Imperial County= =20 where Edison's failure to pay CalEnergy the county's biggest property=20 taxpayer had outsize implications. CalEnergy had put county officials on= =20 notice that it was about to miss a $3.8-million property tax payment. The= =20 uncertainty had prompted the tiny Calipatria Unified School District to=20 postpone a bond issue for badly needed school repairs. ?????Among CalEnergy Chairman David Sokol's first acts after the judge's=20 ruling Thursday was to promise Imperial County Supervisor Wally J. Leimgrub= er=20 that the company would pay its property taxes on time. ?????That is great news Leimgruber said. ?????Within hours of its court victory CalEnergy had stopped transmitting= =20 geothermal power to Edison and begun selling it to El Paso Energy a=20 marketing company that purchased the energy at prevailing rates and resold = it=20 on the spot market. ?????Some of the more than 700 other small energy producers in the state sa= id=20 they were considering similar action against Edison and Pacific Gas &=20 Electric. ?????We absolutely need the right to sell to third parties said Dean=20 Vanech president of Delta Power a New Jersey company that owns five small= =20 gas-fired plants in California and is owed tens of millions of dollars by= =20 Edison. ?????Sokol praised the Imperial County judge and said his company simply=20 wanted the authority to sell its power to a credit-worthy company that in= =20 fact pays for the power. ?????An Edison spokesman said the company was disappointed with the ruling= =20 but sympathized with CalEnergy and other small producers because=20 California's power crisis has placed [them] in financial distress just as= =20 it has placed utilities in financial distress. ?????Edison expressed concern that the ruling would prompt CalEnergy and=20 other small producers to sell their power out of state. Sokol said CalEnerg= y=20 had specifically told El Paso Energy that it hoped its power would remain i= n=20 California but if someone wants to pay a higher price out of state we=20 can't stop them. ?????Sokol said that Edison still owes CalEnergy $140 million and that the= =20 company--along with seven other small producers--had been prepared to file = a=20 petition in federal bankruptcy court in Los Angeles today forcing the utili= ty=20 into involuntary bankruptcy. He said his company no longer intends to do so= =20 and he believed--but wasn't certain--that the other companies would shelve= =20 their plans. ?????Edison filed papers Thursday with the federal Securities and Exchange= =20 Commission showing that it owed $840 million to various small electricity= =20 producers many of which rely on renewable energy sources such as geotherma= l=20 steam solar energy or wind. ?????The alternative energy producers--and utilities--strenuously objected = to=20 the legislation considered in Sacramento on Thursday. The bill spelling ou= t=20 how the utilities are to pay the state and the small producers passed the= =20 Senate on a 27-9 vote the exact two-thirds margin required. But it stalled= =20 in the Assembly on a 46-23 party-line vote well short of two-thirds. ?????When I was a citizen back in Lancaster I heard these stories about= =20 pieces of legislation that were cooked up late at night that . . . were cu= t=20 and pasted together and were rammed through by the Legislature Assemblyma= n=20 George Runner (R-Lancaster) said.

It is a very simple question: Dollars= =20 going out cannot be greater than dollars coming in. ?????The bill AB 8X combined several proposals.

345,Report on Senate Energy Hearing Today,Earlier today the Senate Energy Committee held the first of two days of hearings on Chairman Bingaman's white paper on electricity and the electricity provisions of other pending bills. The hearings will continue tomorrow with all of the five FERC commissioners as witnesses plus private sector witnesses. Today's hearing went well from our perpective with support for Super RTOs and general support for expanding the grid both physically and from an access view point voiced by Senators and witnesses. Sen. Craig Thomas even said four RTOs were too many -- there should be one national RTO to run a national grid. Today's witnesses represented the Dept. of Energy EPSA EEI NRECA APPA IBEW union Alliance to Save Energy ELCON NERC NARUC NASUCA and the State of New Mexico. We will provide a more detailed analysis after completing a review of the lengthy written testimony but a summary of the DOE testimony and the first panel of private sector witnesses follows. 1. DOE said they are working on electricity legislative language. Should be done soon. Chairman Bingaman said they needed to get it done in time for the Committee to consider it when the Committee takes up electricity as early as the second week in September. Deputy Sec. Blake implied that their proposal was or would soon be shared with other Administration agencies for review. 2. In response to questions Blake said that legislative action on jurisdiction questions (fed v. state) would be useful but he stressed that they view any new legislation as clarifying that FERC has authority they feel already exists. He said that while states have an important role to play Congress must recongize the interstate character of the market and the need for open access to the interstate grid. (In response to a question Blake later said that FERC had largely addressed the access issue or would do so.) 3. On reliability he was given a chance to say that DOE supports th NERC consensus language but instead repeated that the Administration favors enforceable reliability standards but wants to work with the Committee on the exact language. I took this as confirmation of what we have heard informally from DOE in terms of key players there not being enamored of the NERC consensus approach at least as it exists in its old long form. 4. Sens. Craig and Cantwell pushed Blake on why the Administration has not fully supported BPA's request for a debt limit increase to finance expansion of the BPA grid. Blake said they support the BPA expansion projects but that OMB feels BPA has enough borrowing authority through 2003. This did not sit well with Craig and Cantwell. I spoke with Sen. Craig in the hall following up on a conversation I had with him the other evening about BPA and he stressed that he is committed to getting BPA the debt limit it needs. As you know commercial has asked us to help BPA given matters pending between Enron and BPA. 5. On the first private sector panel even John Rowe the Co-CEO of Exelon and past EEI chairman (testifying for his company and EEI) said several times that there should be strong RTOs that each cover a wide idea. He said his board voted yesterday to sell its transmission assets IF a strong independent operator could be found. Rowe also said that RTOs should be encouraged (implying not mandatory?). The APPA witness was strong on RTOs saying that all entities will be part of RTOs even without legislation. NRECA said that co-ops would oppose federal jurisdiction over them and that they favor voluntary RTOs. EPSA made the usual case for competition open access RTOs etc.,"Energy; Senate; Hearings; RTOs; FERC; DOE

Media Action: In addition to doing behind the scenes editorial board meetings and the like I would suggest that we get our coalition lined up and ready to release statements for certain key events which are likely to occur over the next several weeks such as: 1. SDG&E's selection of the winning bid to their RFP. Even if Enron isn't selected as the winning bid the coalition should trumpet the market-based solution and the enormous market response to SDG&E's RFP. 2. The Commission vote on UCAN's Emergency Motion. We should be prepared to issue a statement whether the Cmmn votes with us or against us. With us the market can and did provide reasonable expedient solutions to SDG&E's customers and protection from price spikes. Against us despite the overwhelming market response the Cmmn chose to ignore the market solutions and impose more regulation. 3. Potential for ARM members to surface a Provider of Last Resort proposal within the next couple of weeks. 4. ISO Bd. Mtg-keep up pressure against reducing price caps. Coalition Members: Agree that those groups listed should be contacted although the CMA CRA CIU CLECA have been luke-warm in their advocacy. I would add our customers (UC/CSU (especially the San Diego branch) PacTel etc.) NewEnergy has indicated that Kroger/Ralph's grocery stores San Diego-based would give testimonials. I could solicit the members of ARM to identify a key customer contacts for interviews. We could check with our lobbyists and see who they would recommend (wine growers dairy industry etc.) We should also consider the water agencies and the rural counties and the City of Pittsburg. While the immediate message is responding to San Diego's situation this latter group of potential coalition members would go to the larger message (keeping benefits of competitive markets) from a state-wide perspective. What about the City of Pittsburg?

We would like to bring them back to do light-duty work to get them in the swing of working again and also to get some adminstrative work done. I am concerned that bringing these employees back to work on light duty will cause these cases to become an Enron liability rather than an MG liability. I discussed this with Pat McCarthy the labor and employment law attorney we are using in NJ and he said that the liability would typically not transfer to GSP just because we brought them back . . . it would still be an MG liability UNLESS THE EMPLOYEE HURT HIMSELF AGAIN. In which case GSP owns it. However Pat said that a lot of what determines the ownership of the worker's comp cases is written into the purchase and sale agreement. He said that there may be language that addresses an employee's return to work from worker's comp. I know that we have an ongoing dispute about worker's comp with MG at this point. What would be your recommendation on bringing these employees back to work? As a bit of additional info one of the two employees seems eager to come back . . . the other one does not.

354,House Energy Committee Passes First Energy Package,Late this morning the House Energy and Commerce Committee adoped the committee print as amended of an energy package that addresses conservation clean coal renewables hydro nuclear and boutique fuels. The vote was 50 to 5 to report the bill. Other committees -- Ways and Means Science and Resources -- also moved their energy bills this week. Thus the House is on track to consider a merged package before the start of the August Recess on August 3rd. As to electricity during the several days of debate this week both Chairmen Tauzin and Barton reaffirmed their intention to next move to electricity issues. Mr. Barton's staff advised me this morning that the subcommittee he chairs will hold a hearing on Friday July 20th on all electricity issues other than transmission. While Mr. Barton has publicly held out hope of marking up an electricity bill this month sources on and off the committee do not see this timetable as realistic. On the Senate side the majority staff is working on an electricity white paper that may be circulated for comment next week. Below is a recap of action on amendments of interest to Enron: 1. Last night on a largely partisan vote (with Democrats Hall Green and John voting with the Republicans) the Committee rejected an amendment by Rep. Jane Harman (D-CA) (that was to have been offered by Rep. Anna Eshoo (D-CA)) that would have retroactively amended the FERC refund date and essentially ordered refunds regardless of amounts owed to power sellers. 2. First thing this morning the Committee again on a largely partisan basis (with Democrats Hall Green John and Towns) rejected a Waxman amendment to impose cost-of-service rates on all power in the West (other than generation added after 1/1/01). (Originally Mr. Waxman was going to offer amendment to impose cost-of-service rates only on those who do not supply all available power during an emergency but he ended up offering basically what he had pursued in subcommittee on the old Californa Only bill.) 3. The Committee adopted an amendment by Rep. Shadegg to amend the Natural Gas Act to make it clear that a natural gas transportation facility shall not be added to the National Register of Historic Places until FERC has abandoned the facility. Apparently there have been some instances of old pipelines being considered as historic places under federal law. The House Resources Committee added a similar amendment to its package yesterday. 4. By voice vote the Committee rejected a Waxman Amendment to require the president to propose and implement a plan to bring U.S. greenhouse gases down to 1990 levels. There was strong opposition voiced by many Republicans and Democrats to this amendment. 5. By mixed vote of 24 to 29 the Committee defeated a Waxman Amendment to set cost and performance goals for renewables including wind power and authorize federal funds to assist with commercial project costs (up to 50 percent).,"Energy; House Energy Committee; Legislation; FERC; Natural Gas Act; Greenhouse Gases; Renewables

Linda Robertson 05/11/2001 04:32 PM To: Steven J Kean/NA/Enron@Enron cc: Subject: Barton Bill You seemed troubled by the call to Barton. This bill may or may not be subsumed by the comprehensive energy bill that Congress undertakes this summer. Both bills have a very difficult if not nearly impossible path ahead given that the Democrats are in no mood for compromise. The call to Barton was to: a) repair relationships (and with the Wall Street Journal calling Barton about his troubled past with Enron repair is needed) b) proclaim victory even of a limited nature (something I think Enron has not done much of) c) build a further bond with Barton so we would have more input at full Committee (something we will need given the chances that this will go off the track are real) and d) allow Enron to get significant credit for the defeat of price caps. I hear from lots of DC sources that we have not had any success in the House Energy and Commerce Committee. Numerous folks at the markup noted in private conversations that this was Enron's first real role in the Committee. Thus even though this is a very limited bill the call made sense. I do not think that this means we should call the White House to push the bill with them. The bill itself still has lots of obstacles and many potential threats ahead.,"Politics; Energy; Enron

BYLINE: JULIE TAMAKI MIGUEL BUSTILLO TIMES STAFF WRITERS DATELINE: SACRAMENTO BODY: ??Every crisis has its symbol. ??Watergate had Deep Throat. The S&L scandal had Charles Keating. O.J. did--or didn't--have a bloody glove. ??Here in the Capitol the hot dog has become an unlikely metaphor for the state's energy crisis. ??In packed news conferences and heated Assembly floor debates lawmakers from both parties have evoked images of the ordinary dog to help explain an extraordinary mess. ??The genesis of this statehouse trend is difficult to determine. Assemblyman Fred Keeley appears to be the first to have tossed the hot dog into the political fire. ??During a crucial Assembly discussion in January the Boulder Creek Democrat recited the lyrics to a familiar Oscar Mayer jingle as a way of admitting that a controversial bill to have the state buy electricity to avoid blackouts was unpalatable but necessary. ??It's the dog kids love to bite said Keeley of the jingle. Well this is the bill people love to hate. ??A bizarre partisan hot dog duel ensued. Assemblyman John Campbell (R-Irvine) responded by likening the unpredictable financial consequences of the Keeley legislation to biting recklessly into mystery meat. ??Before I bite into it I see what's on the outside but I can't see the inside Campbell said. If nobody can tell me what's on the inside it may be bitter it may be bad it may make me sick. ??Assemblywoman Carole Migden (D-San Francisco) angrily fired back wanting to know why Campbell a professed hot dog eater was suddenly so critical of its unknown contents. ??It's OK to eat a hot dog that's full of animal bones and hair Migden said. That's a hot dog that's OK with you but this kind of hot dog isn't. ??Yet it was Senate leader John Burton who made it the key ingredient in a Capitol catch phrase. ??Burton described a plan to purchase the electrical power grid from the state's private utilities as a fair swap saying: I give you a dollar you give me a hot dog. ??The sound-bite quickly took on a life of its own. With the cost of the energy crisis growing faster than the price of ballpark franks critics doubted the public's appetite for a multibillion-dollar hot dog. ??Do you really want a hot dog? That is the question said Jan Smutny-Jones executive director of the Independent Energy Producers a trade group for power generators. ??Not content to let a dog lie in its bun lawmakers such as Assemblyman Bill Leonard (R-San Bernardino) kept the hot dog in public discourse. ??When Pacific Gas & Electric Co. filed for bankruptcy protection Leonard was one of a chorus of legislators who questioned the merits of purchasing the remaining portion of the power lines calling it not even half a hot dog. ??Added Assemblyman Bill Campbell (R-Villa Park): It's like paying Mercedes prices for a broken down hot dog cart. ??In recent weeks the hot dog rhetoric appeared to have gone cold. Then Assemblyman Juan Vargas (D-San Diego) revived it. ??After enduring hours of testimony on details of the deal to purchase Edison's power lines Vargas said his opinion of the dollar-equals-hot-dog deal had diminished. ??They're trying to charge us for a hot dog Vargas said of the utility but it looks like we're only going to be getting a wienie. ??Reliant Vice President John Stout also recently weighed in with his own hot dog analogy as he tried to explain why his company's income had jumped so much during the crisis. ??If you have a hot dog stand and you go out and buy five to six more hot dog stands Stout said referring to his company's purchase of power plants then naturally you would expect the operating income to go up. ??Alas the dog days of summer have yet to begin.

Gray Davis pursued a new strategy yesterday to control wholesale electricity costs by demanding that federal regulators ban two generators from selling power in California at market rates arguing that they have manipulated the market to their advantage. ???Meanwhile the Davis administration lambasted a federal plan to implement temporary price controls scheduled to go into effect Tuesday. State officials said the measures would do nothing to tame California's out-of-control costs for electricity. ???Davis whose calls for broader price limits on wholesale electricity have been rejected repeatedly by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is scheduled to meet with President Bush next week to ask Washington to do more to help California. ???Federal regulators said that prices were 'unjust and unreasonable' nearly nine months ago but they have been AWOL ever since Davis said in a statement. ???The California Independent System Operator managers of the state's electrical grid asked energy regulators yesterday to revoke the authority they have given Williams Energy and AES Inc. to sell power at market-based rates. Instead the Davis administration wants the companies to be forced to sell at cost-plus rates which would ensure a reasonable but limited profit. ???Market-based rate authority is not an entitlement the ISO said in a filing with federal regulators. ???The ISO asked regulators to act by June 15 saying that any delay places California consumers and the state's economy at extreme peril. ???Similar filings against other companies such as Mirant Duke and Reliant are being considered said Charles Robinson general counsel for the ISO. ???Robinson said the ISO has a well developed record of price manipulation by the two companies. He said information previously given to federal regulators proved the prices charged to California were excessive. ???'GRANDSTANDING' ACCUSATION ???Aaron Thomas a spokesman for Virginia-based AES said the administration is grandstanding. ???This is akin to the rhetoric the governor has used for the past several months he said. We are well below the index FERC uses to establish concerns about market power. ???As to this rhetoric about these companies abusing the marketplace -- check the facts. We lost money last year Thomas said. ???A spokeswoman for Williams said the company would not comment because it had not seen the filing. ???Earlier this month Oklahoma-based Williams agreed to pay $8 million to settle charges with FERC that the company was purposely withholding electricity from California's power market. The company admitted no wrongdoing and officials said a full hearing would have cleared the company. ???If the regulatory commission denies the state's requests or doesn't act in the time frame we believe is necessary to prevent harm the state can appeal to a circuit court Robinson said. ???BUSH VISIT POSTURING CHARGE ???Jan Smutny-Jones head of the Independent Energy Producers Association said the move is posturing by Davis ahead of Bush's visit. ???This is an interesting welcome mat for President Bush he said. Do we want a dialogue or a diatribe? ???In advance of Bush's visit Vice President Dick Cheney said yesterday that nothing more can be done to help solve California's power problems this summer. ???He also rejected price controls saying that previous efforts have contributed to a supply shortage. ???A spokesman for Davis rejected that notion and denied that the timing of yesterday's announcements were connected to the Bush-Davis meeting. ???Davis aides expressed hope that Bush's two new FERC commissioners Pat Wood III a close Bush ally expected to take over the chairmanship of the board and Nora Mead Brownell a state utility regulator in Pennsylvania would hear California's pleas. The two new commissioners were confirmed yesterday by the U.S. Senate. ???Among the things Davis wants changed is the regulatory commission temporary price relief plan scheduled to take effect Tuesday. ???The regulators would limit wholesale prices during power alerts in California when reserves drop below 7 percent of available capacity. ???Many state officials believe that doesn't go far enough. The state Assembly in documents to be filed Tuesday said price controls should cover all hours -- not just power emergencies. ???And there is a chance the controls will be in effect for just a few days. Under the regulatory commission plan the state and the three investor-owned utilities must file a proposal to join a regional transmission organization by June 1. If they do not to do so the price controls disappear. ???Davis administration officials expect to file another response dealing with the regional transmission organization by Friday Robinson said. The Assembly filing rejects joining such an organization which federal officials favor as a means to better manage and improve grid capacity in the West.

EMSHWILLER Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL On the eve of a meeting Tuesday between President George Bush and California Gov. Gray Davis top advisers to the governor said the state could be pushed into recession unless the federal government imposes temporary price caps to contain soaring wholesale electricity costs. President Bush has consistently opposed price caps. The governor's team called a Memorial Day news conference to highlight what they saw as the dangers to the economy of the state and possibly the nation from the tens of billions of dollars being spent this year to purchase electricity. The governor's aides estimated that statewide wholesale electricity purchases this year could hit $50 billion compared with about $7 billion in 1999. Some estimates for this year's power expenditures are even higher. If California were a separate nation an energy shock of that magnitude would be expected to cause a significant recession said Alan Blinder a former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve at the conference. While being part of a broader national economy could somewhat mitigate the impact the higher power costs are a recipe for stagflation in California added Mr. Blinder. Stagflation refers to stagnant economic conditions and inflation -- a condition that struck the nation when energy prices soared in the 1970s. Though the advisers painted perhaps the dreariest outlook yet to come from the governor's office they said that the Davis plan for financing the state's electricity purchases remains intact. As reported the state plans to sell about $12.5 billion in bonds later this year. The state has been purchasing electricity since January when its failed utility-deregulation plan left California's two biggest utilities financially unable to continue buying power. If price caps were instituted the state might have to borrow less money than anticipated or at least face a decreased danger of having to borrow more if the power situation gets worse said Joseph Fichera chief executive of New York-based Saber Partners LLC and an adviser to Mr. Davis. The governor plans to press his case for price caps over the next six to 18 months as supplies are increased with new power plants due to come into operation the advisers said. However Mr. Bush and other federal officials have repeatedly said that they believe price caps would be counterproductive and discourage the building of new power plants. Write to John R.

Robert Hillman BODY: ??LOS ANGELES _ President Bush landed in hostile territory Monday night beginning his first presidential visit to California amid a pressing energy crisis that he says he cannot ease in the short term. ??We welcome him to California said California Gov. Gray Davis a Democrat who has waged a long-distance war with the Republican president over the high cost and short supply of electricity in the nation's most populous state. ??I hope he has an opportunity to talk firsthand to some of the people who are adversely impacted by the very high rates we're paying for electricity. ??But the president's carefully scrubbed schedule for the next two days provides little time for such an opportunity although he will confer privately with business leaders to discuss high-tech solutions to the state's energy problems. ??Arriving on a cross-country flight that touched down in Arizona for a Memorial Day tribute Bush headed off to prepare for an early-morning stop Tuesday to promote energy conservation at the Marine Corps' Camp Pendleton and a luncheon address to the Los Angeles World Affairs Council. ??On Wednesday he'll visit Sequoia National Park near Fresno Calif. to launch a new drive to clean up and fix up national parks. ??He'll also meet privately Tuesday afternoon with Davis in what the Los Angeles Times characterized as a peace summit. But no major shifts in policy are expected. White House aides suggest that the meeting will be a success if the governor even temporarily tempers his sometimes-harsh words for the administration. ??The president's focus is going to be on solving problems. He's not interested in finger-pointing White House press secretary Ari Fleischer said. ??Whether people agree or disagree with the specifics of his energy plan I think most Americans and most Californians are very pleased to see a president who is leading and taking action in addressing the issue head on. ??However recent public opinion polls show the president and the governor taking hits for the energy crisis in California. ??The Field Poll finished a week ago found that 54 percent of those surveyed believed Bush had handled the energy problems poorly with Davis faring somewhat better at 38 percent. The margin of error for the 1015 California interviews was 3.2 percentage points. ??An earlier survey by the Public Policy Institute of California found Davis' job approval rating plummeting from 63 percent in January to 46 percent in May as the state's energy troubles escalated. Bush's overall approval rating was higher at 57 percent but still just as many of those surveyed gave him low marks for his handling of energy issues. That margin of error for 2001 interviews was 2 percentage points. ??In short political analyst Sherry Bebitch Jeffe said Bush's visit to the state _ in his 19th week as president after already visiting more than half the other states _ is long overdue. ??His not responding or not being perceived to respond to the short-term needs of California has allowed Davis' arguments to resonate _ that the federal government is uncaring is insensitive Jeffe said. ??In his national energy policy unveiled nearly two weeks ago Bush offered a series of mostly long-term recommendations to conserve energy find more of it and substantially upgrade and expand the nation's oil refineries and transmission systems for natural gas and electricity. ??Davis complaining that Texas energy companies in particular are gouging Californians has urged Bush to embrace price controls for wholesale electricity but the president has steadfastly refused. Vice President Dick Cheney who oversaw development of the White House energy policy emphasized as recently as Friday that there's no quick fix on the way for California. ??Long term the answer is to build more power plants and that's exactly what they're doing Cheney told the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. But they're not going to have enough new capacity online this summer to avoid blackouts. ??So the energy woes continue to fester in California. It's not just electricity and rolling blackouts. Gasoline prices of $2-and-more-a-gallon have become commonplace as well. ??The gas bothers me more than the electric said Tait Kmentt who runs a legal process serving business in Irvine Calif. Gas prices are killing me. ??At $2.25-a-gallon for premium gasoline he says it costs him more than $40 to fill up his new Mercedes _ with no relief in sight. ??A newcomer to the state Kmentt voted for Bush last fall and said he's glad the president is finally visiting California. But Kmentt cautioned This will be a big test to see how concerned he is. ??Kmentt said he understands the state's energy troubles are a huge problem that can't be fixed overnight and right now he's blaming the power companies for the high price of electricity. ??I just think the public is being lied to he said. ??Still this is not good news for Bush who has been increasingly portrayed by Democrats as a Texas oilman still beholden to the industry. California which he lost last fall to Al Gore by 12 percentage points has become increasingly a political headache. ??Where his predecessor Bill Clinton seemed politically and personally comfortable Bush is not suggests Jeffe a senior scholar in the School of Policy Planning and Development at the University of Southern California. ??An ego cannot be buoyed by losing the state by 12 points she said. We are the state that was responsible for giving Al Gore his popular vote victory. ??With the Senate now headed for Democratic control Jeffe said Bush's visit to California _ and others that will surely follow _ are essential to help Republicans hold their base in the House. ??If the energy crisis persists in California further punishing its economy the ripple effects will certainly spread she said. ??George Bush remembers the influence of the economy on the career of an incumbent president Jeffe said pointing to Bush's father who was defeated by Clinton during an economic slump in 1992. ??It took a while she said but people are beginning to get angry. ??(c) 2001 The Dallas Morning News. ??Visit The Dallas Morning News on the World Wide Web at http://www.dallasnews.com/ JOURNAL-CODE: DA LOAD-DATE: May 29 2001 of 98 DOCUMENTS 2001 / Los Angeles Times Angeles Times ??????????????????????May 29 2001 Tuesday ?Home Edition SECTION: California Part 2 Page 1 Metro Desk LENGTH: 1178 words HEADLINE: Governor to Stress Price Caps to Bush Power: In a meeting today with the president Davis will present a letter from economists backing cost controls and demand federal assistance. BYLINE: DAN MORAIN JAMES GERSTENZANG TIMES STAFF WRITERS BODY: ??Gov. Gray Davis will present a letter to President Bush today from top economists advocating wholesale electricity price controls warning Monday that a failure by Bush to help California solve its energy crisis could signal to other regions that he may ignore their pleas. ??Bush making his first trip to California has set aside 20 minutes this afternoon to meet with Davis in Century City. In an interview with The Times the Democratic governor vowed to repeat his request that the federal government move to cap wholesale power prices. Failure to act swiftly threatens the state and national economy Davis said. ??I want him to understand Davis said that if California has to pay 700 times more for electricity in 2001 than it did just two years ago it could well drag our economy into a recession and could conceivably trigger a national recession. That is not good for anyone. ??In the letter 10 economists including Cornell professor emeritus Alfred Kahn a major proponent of airline deregulation told of their deep concern about the failure of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to stabilize wholesale electricity prices in California. The economists faxed the letter to the White House on Friday afternoon and provided the governor with a copy to present to Bush today. ??FERC's failure to act now will have dire consequences for the state of California and will set back potentially fatally the diffusion of competitive electricity markets across the country the economists led by Frank Wolak of Stanford University wrote. Moreover this negative experience with electricity restructuring could delay or reverse current efforts to introduce competition into other formerly regulated industries. ??Davis called the letter very significant validation of what we've been saying: The marketplace is not working and FERC has an obligation to act. ??We're not pleading for relief we're entitled to it Davis said. ??Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney repeatedly have said such controls never work. In California caps might worsen the situation by limiting supply they have argued resulting in more blackouts this summer when demand for electricity is highest. ??The Bush-Davis meeting has had all the buildup of the political equivalent of a title fight: On one side the Democratic governor of the nation's most populous state which Bush lost by more than 1 million votes in November. On the other the new president coming off a roller coaster week of political defeat (the shift in control of the Senate) and victory (passage of his tax-cut plan) whose work in the Texas oil industry gives him a special history in the topic at hand. ??From afar Davis has battled the Bush administration's energy policy. But said Dan Bartlett one of the president's chief communications advisors The president has some interesting views on this topic as well with some experience himself. ??Bush's Energy secretary Spencer Abraham took steps Monday to increase electricity transmission capacity in California. He ordered the Western Area Power Administration a division of the Energy Department that is responsible for marketing electricity from federal water projects in 15 Western states to finish its planning for extra transmission capacity. ??At issue is so-called Path 15 an 84-mile stretch of power lines with insufficient capacity to carry the necessary load between Southern California and the northern part of the state especially during peak hours. The central question is whether financing is available for a new transmission line. ??Davis lauded the action but said the president needs to do more. ??If I have any advice to him of a political nature it is take a chapter out of President Clinton's book. ?? [Clinton] was very attentive to California and as a result did better in 1996 than he did in '92. People felt he was here for us when we needed help. We need help. ??Davis said that on a recent trip to Chicago officials there worried that if Bush won't offer California some relief he may not offer us relief in a catastrophe. ??Among the facts and figures Davis intends to show the president is a chart showing that California paid $1.2 billion for electricity in the first quarter of 1999 $1.8 billion for the same period last year and as much as $10.3 billion for electricity in the first three months of this year--at a time when conservation efforts had been taking hold and demand was down. ??I hope the president will be as stunned as I am said Davis who is watching as the state spends more than $55 million a day to buy electricity that private utilities can no longer afford. ??Davis said that though he is trying to speed construction of power plants encourage conservation and return the private utilities to financial stability the federal government has control over wholesale power prices. ??Therein lies the final piece of this puzzle Davis said. If it falls into place we're on the way to putting this issue behind us. If it doesn't fall into place it could create real economic havoc here and across the country. ??Davis said that if Bush refuses to impose price controls he should find some way to help us consistent with his own belief. ??Turning a deaf ear not only won't be well received here Davis said. It likely won't be received well elsewhere. ??The state's energy crisis has posed a ticklish dilemma for Bush's busy travel schedulers: Had he visited earlier it would have been awkward not to focus on energy issues. But until 11 days ago when a task force led by Cheney produced energy proposals there would have been little Bush could say. ??Karen Hughes the president's counselor made it clear that regardless of the pressure Bush will not yield on price caps. ??We want to help. The president is very concerned about the energy situation and blackouts she said. But limiting the wholesale price of energy would only discourage its production Hughes said. ??California is the 30th state Bush has visited since taking office Jan. 20. His staff said the delay had to do not with energy issues but with politics and geography. ??With the administration focused in its first months on winning approval of the tax cut the president's travels were largely dictated by that effort his aides said. ??Besides the president confided recently even with Air Force One at the ready it just takes too long to fly from Washington to California. ??Still Hughes said the president is not ignoring California. Condoleezza Rice the president's national security advisor and a former Californian sits next to Hughes every morning at the daily meeting of the White House senior staff she said. ??What's more the president has many friends in California Hughes said adding: Ernie has a home in California these days. Ernie is the Bush family cat that is living with a friend in Brentwood while the First Family lives in the White House. ??* ??Times Staff Writer Massie Ritsch contributed to this story.

BYLINE: MITCHELL LANDSBERG TIMES STAFF WRITER DATELINE: McKITTRICK Calif. BODY: ??You could think of this as California's own little slice of west Texas. ??Here in the scruffy brown hills of western Kern County oil rigs grow more easily than trees pickups are more common than cars and chicken fried steak is the most popular dish at Mike and Annie's McKittrick Hotel. ??The hotel--which no longer offers lodging just food and drink and plenty of it--is bustling these days with the roustabout energy of a Lone Star construction camp. Just down the road a mammoth electrical power plant is rising out of the sagebrush its generators housed in four boxy buildings the size of airplane hangars. ??It is one of six new major gas-fired power plants expected to be built in Kern County over the next several years an electrical construction boom unmatched anywhere in California. Kern which already has a large surplus of electricity is cementing its place as California's energy capital assuming far more than its share of the burden in recharging the state's drained power supplies. ??Over the next several years the county will add nearly 5000 megawatts of power to the statewide grid. That is more than California now imports on average from out-of-state suppliers. It's enough to supply about five counties the size of Kern which fills the dusty southern rim of the San Joaquin Valley and has a population of 662000. ??In some parts of the state a proposal to build a new power plant is a call to throw up the barricades. In recent months intense community opposition has forced developers to pull back proposals to build major plants in South Gate and San Jose although Gov. Gray Davis has tried to revive plans for the San Jose plant. ??You don't hear a lot of not-in-my-backyard talk in Kern County. ??There should be power plants in everybody's backyard said Paul Gipe chairman of the Kern chapter of the Sierra Club which did not oppose any of the new plants. If people are concerned about having too many power plants they should think twice when they flip on the light switch. ??New natural gas-fired power plants Gipe reasoned are relatively clean and will not add significantly to the county's serious air pollution problems. Ideally he said they will allow the state to close some older dirtier plants that cause considerably more environmental damage. ??If environmentalists don't oppose the plants it's not too much of a leap to guess that some people might be positively thrilled about them. ??Just try for instance asking somebody in Taft an oil center south of McKittrick. It's more money coming into Kern County--that's the way I look at it said Pamela Dunlap who runs a downtown thrift shop. ??An Economy Rooted in the Oil Industry ??She stood in the twilight outside her shop on a street that embodies many of the most attractive attributes of small town Americana--with one small difference. Where some towns might have statues of their founders or war heroes in prominent public places Taft has erected small oil rigs and other pieces of drilling machinery a reminder of its economic roots. ??That Kern County has stepped up as California's blackout-buster is perhaps not surprising. ??To begin with there's geography. Kern stands astride California's major north-south electrical transmission lines at precisely the spot at which they divide between the service areas of Pacific Gas & Electric which serves Northern California and Southern California Edison. That spot can be pinpointed as the Midway substation a vast jungle of humming wires transformers and circuit breakers that lies a short distance west of Interstate 5 in the town of Buttonwillow. ??Already massive new circuit-breakers--they look like Frankenstein helmets sprouting 5-foot-long sparkplugs--are being erected at Midway to handle the power from two major plants that will be revving up in the coming months: PG&E National Energy's La Paloma plant the one near McKittrick and Edison Mission Energy's Sunrise plant just south of Taft. ??The county is served by two major natural gas pipelines which will be tapped to run the plants. In fact Kern contains the state's largest known reservoirs of natural gas. ??Another of Kern's geographic advantages? ??You look around and you'll see there aren't a lot of people living around here observed Stephen Whaley who is overseeing construction of the Sunrise plant. In the surrounding hills an orchard of oil rigs bobbed in the morning haze. Dirt roads cut crudely across the landscape bisecting a crisscross of steam pipes fuel lines and electrical wires. ??This area is all about oil Whaley said. Casting a glance at the modular 560-megawatt plant rising behind him he added with a wry smile You know I guess you could look at this from the road and you could make the argument that it improves the looks. ??The Sunrise plant a relatively simple single-cycle plant is expected to fire up 320 megawatts of its total output by Aug. 1 a scant nine months after construction began. The other plants--more complex and efficient dual-cycle operations--will be opening over the next several years assuming all receive final approval. ??The lack of major opposition to the plants is of course another reason developers see Kern County as a good place to build. The county has long had a more intimate relationship with energy--oil gas electricity--than most places. To people here the link between a natural gas well and a lightbulb or an oil derrick and a gas pedal is neither theoretical nor especially threatening. They're comfortable with energy. ??Kern produces more crude oil than any other county in the United States outside Alaska. Property taxes from oil companies have helped build handsome new schools in Bakersfield the county seat and largest city. The companies' big payrolls have helped populate elegant subdivisions with names that sound vaguely Houstonian: Seven Oaks River Oaks Landmark Estates. ??Which brings us to the Texas connection. ??It's hard to overlook it in a county that runs on oil and cotton and boasts a country music scene to rival Austin's. Conversations in the finer Bakersfield restaurants are filled with references to trips to Texas of colleagues in Midland and Odessa. A Bakersfield radio station was running a contest recently: The winners would be flown to a bull riding championship in Houston. ??Until December 1999 American Airlines offered direct jet service between Bakersfield and Dallas. It stopped after Occidental Petroleum moved its headquarters from Bakersfield to Houston. ??This is a county where President Bush received more support in the November election than he did in Texas his home state. But then Bush already had a Bakersfield connection: He lived there briefly as a child when his father former President George Bush worked in the Kern oil fields. ??You look at the topography around Bakersfield and the county's morals and ethics--that predominantly conservative attitude that we have around here--and you look at the oil and you could be in Midland said John Allen the general manager of Occidental of Elk Hills which is developing a power plant in tandem with Sempra Energy of San Diego. ??A lot of people in Kern County will tell you they don't mind being an energy farm for the state. It's a living after all. ??It's good to be working at home said Joe Ryan a Bakersfield pipe welder who has spent years on the road seeking the heavy construction work that seemed to have vanished in his hometown. Now he's working at the La Paloma plant a 1048-megawatt behemoth that will come online in phases beginning in December. ??About 800 people are at work on the plant and several hundred more will be employed in the coming months. And after that plant is done there will be others to build. ??This is a good job here I tell you what said Ryan 47 who has been banking his overtime on six 10-hour days a week--sometimes more. ??County Sees Itself as 'Part of the Solution' ??But there are some signs of simmering resentment especially among county leadership. After all if every other county produced just half the electricity that Kern generates California wouldn't have an energy crisis. And people in Kern County are getting hit with the same spring-loaded electricity bills the same rolling blackouts as everybody else. ??I think the people of California are either going to be part of the solution or part of the problem said Assemblyman Roy Ashburn (R-Bakersfield). And in Kern County we have a long history of being part of the solution especially when it comes to energy issues. ??Elsewhere in the state Ashburn sees a lot of arrogance--people who enjoy the benefits of a very high quality of life enjoy the benefits of electric power for jobs and for their personal life but with an exclusivity that it's someone else's problem to create that for them. We don't have that attitude in Kern County. ??Power Buildup in Kern County ??Six new major gas-fired power plants are expected to be built in Kern County over the next several years making the county the power capital of the state. ??* ??RELATED STORY ??Letter to Bush: Gov.

SANGER DATELINE: LOS ANGELES May 28 BODY: ??Days after he suffered the biggest political setback of his four-month-old presidency and then won the tax cut that he staked his campaign upon President Bush traveled tonight to California carefully calibrating how to deal with the state's energy crisis. ??After Memorial Day celebrations in Washington and Mesa Ariz. Mr. Bush began his first visit as president to the most populous state which he lost by roughly 12 percentage points in November's election. The visit seems likely to showcase the clash between two very different energy strategies and political strategies. ???Mr. Bush will meet briefly on Tuesday with Gov. Gray Davis who will insist as he did again today that the federal government impose price caps on wholesale electric power. ??The White House says Mr. Bush will refuse again. He will argue that such caps would only discourage increased production of electric power. We think that's a mistake Vice President Dick Cheney said on Friday talking about why he rejected those options when he prepared the energy policy the administration made public 10 days ago. ??But Mr. Bush knows that how he handles the California energy crisis could prove critical to his political fortunes especially now that his party's loss of control in the Senate seems bound to slow or derail passage of major elements of his energy plan. ??Moreover the president can no longer argue that the best cure for high energy prices is a tax cut because that is now legislative history. As one of his aides said this weekend after Congress approved the $1.35 trillion tax cut that will be phased in over the next 10 years we will have to turn now to the other arguments. ??Most of those arguments involve urging the rest of the country not to follow California in a partial deregulation of the market with disastrous results. ??Repeatedly Mr. Bush has chastised California's politicians and by implication Mr. Davis himself for ignoring politically unpalatable choices to avert the state's power-generating crisis. Ten days ago standing in front of a hydroelectric plant in Pennsylvania Mr. Bush used the state as Exhibit A for his argument about what happens when population rises when over-regulation freezes the construction of new power plants and the stringing of new transmission lines and when politicians fail to plan for the long term. ??The problems in California shows that you cannot conserve your way to energy independence Mr. Bush said then. ??At the same time his aides were pointing to polls showing Mr. Davis's approval ratings plunging. They did not mention that Mr. Bush's ratings in the state were hardly any better. A series of recent polls show that roughly two-thirds of Californians believe Mr. Bush should be doing far more to help the state though it is unclear exactly what kind of help they have in mind. ??So Mr. Bush's aides have been struggling for days to choreograph the two-day visit here trying to find ways to differ with Mr. Davis without seeming callous about the problem or in conflict with the state. ??The betting is that Mr. Bush will focus on long-term solutions in contrast to Mr. Davis's call for the quicker fix of price caps. ??The effort started today. Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham issued an order of chiefly symbolic importance saying his department would move quickly to determine whether investors were interested in financing and co-owning a new transmission line that could bring more power to the state. ??The level of interest will be a factor in the decision to build the line later this year the Energy Department said. It said that it would proceed with studies of how the land could be acquired by eminent domain if necessary and that it would speed ahead with environmental reviews. ??But Mr. Abraham left wide open the question of whether Washington would go ahead with the project even if no private financing was available. ??The Bush administration is taking a leadership role in addressing a long-neglected problem in California's electricity transmission system Mr. Abraham said. California's electricity problems developed over a period of years and cannot be solved overnight. However we can move now on actions that will help avert the same types of problems from recurring year after year. ??The statement was clearly intended as a prelude to the meeting with Mr. Davis which will be closed to the press. So will a meeting with energy entrepreneurs. (Mr. Bush passed on Mr. Davis's suggestion of a forum with small-business owners and residents who have seen the lights go out.) ??Few expect Mr. Bush or Mr. Davis to change his mind about energy caps after their meeting. ??But for Mr. Bush it will not all be tough love. On Tuesday morning Mr. Bush is scheduled to travel to Camp Pendleton to repeat his call for the military and other federal users of power in California to flip off their switches whenever possible. But given his own comments and Mr. Cheney's about the limited utility of conservation that order could strike some Californians as a little hollow. ??Later he will give a trade speech in Los Angeles underscoring the message that if California hopes to remain the world's greatest exporter of high technology -- if it were a nation California would be the world's sixth-largest economy -- it must find new ways to produce and deliver electricity. ??Already leading Silicon Valley companies are threatening to build their next-generation chip fabrication plants elsewhere probably in Texas which has a surplus of generating capacity a move that would further undermine Mr. Davis's stewardship. ??In fact Mr. Bush's Texas roots will never be far from the political battlefield here. Mr. Davis has accused Texas energy companies of profiteering at California's expense. To press the case he has hired two political operatives from the Clinton White House Marc D. Fabiani and Chris Lehane who are being paid tens of thousands of dollars a month to make the case for price caps. ??California's attorney general Bill Lockyer also a Democrat suggested to The Wall Street Journal last week that some time in jail would be the best way to deal with one of Mr. Bush's biggest supporters -- Kenneth Lay who heads the Enron Corporation and has sought to influence the selection of members of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. ??The comments may have been partly facetious but they were not interpreted that way here. ??http://www.nytimes.com LOAD-DATE: May 29 2001 of 98 DOCUMENTS ??????????????Copyright 2001 Knight Ridder/Tribune News Service ???????????????????????Knight Ridder/Tribune News Service ??????????????????????????The Orange County Register 29 2001 Tuesday SECTION: DOMESTIC NEWS KR-ACC-NO: ?K7500 LENGTH: 825 words HEADLINE: California's power crisis generating lots of heat BYLINE: By John Howard BODY: ??SACRAMENTO Calif. _ Detectives would seem to be tripping over each other to discover who did what to whom and why in California's energy crisis. ??While electricity may be scarce investigations are plentiful. A dozen major probes are afoot many overlap and more loom. The atmosphere is heated the rhetoric strong. State federal and local investigators along with court officers financial experts and special investigators are poring over thousands of pages of documents from government agencies and private companies. ??At the top of the swarming heap is the $10 million investigation mounted by the state Attorney General's Office to answer the core question: Did a handful of power sellers fix prices to bilk Californians of billions of dollars? ??But it's not just the government that is busy. The companies themselves _ which have categorically denied any wrongdoing _ are overwhelmed by the scrutiny. ??We are supplying reams and reams of documents. ... It is a distraction from our day-to-day work there's no question said Tom Williams of North Carolina-based Duke Energy which operates several power plants in California. It affects our employees and their families this barrage of innuendo. I don't know what more we can do. ??Accompanying the investigations are at least a half-dozen lawsuits against the companies by individuals. Like the probes the suits contend the companies improperly manipulated the market. Legislative leaders meanwhile have sued the federal government contending it has failed to protect consumers from price-gouging. ??This all permeates our business in so many ways said Gary Ackerman of the Western States Power Forum a group that represents power sellers and buyers in the West. It even affects my ability to talk to the newspapers because we're afraid statements may turn up later and be used as evidence. We're not sure what we're dealing with whether a suit or even a grand jury if the (attorney general) decides to take criminal action as he said he might. ??The state's top prosecutor said that indeed criminal charges are a possibility. ??There is an investigation under way that involves potential criminal conduct said Sandra Michioku a spokeswoman for Attorney General Bill Lockyer. It could be at least eight weeks before that probe is completed she said. ??Other investigating agencies include the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission the California Public Utilities Commission the city attorneys' offices in Long Beach Los Angeles and San Francisco California's grid manager the Independent System Operator the obscure Electricity Oversight Board which oversees the ISO and the state Senate and Assembly. ??The state has even considered asking two more federal agencies the Department of Energy and the Federal Trade Commission to get into the act. Some offices are conducting multiple investigations. In the case of at least two agencies the PUC and the Attorney General's Office the investigations are being at least partly coordinated. Some agencies are examining the same issues. The PUC the attorney general and ISO for example all are looking at whether power plants were shut down to drive up demand and prices. ??There is a lot of overlap and there probably are problems of coordination said Nettie Hoge of The Utility Reform Network of San Francisco a grass-roots watchdog group. ??With so many agencies trying to extract information Hoge said even those who have done no wrong are concerned about talking freely because of the greater likelihood that proprietary information will leak to competitors. ??Others feel the overlap is beneficial. ??When you're up against an industry as wealthy and powerful as the energy industry it's probably better to double-team them said Doug Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights. ??Hoge believes that if any investigation is going to produce results it will be Lockyer's because the governor has thrown all the resources that way. ??Investigators have requested mountains of paperwork. Transaction and maintenance documents market reports financial records even e-mails _ all have been sought. ??Martin Wilson a spokesman for Texas-based Reliant contends the intensity of the probes could have negative long-term effect on California's business climate. ??There is a climate of instability and uncertainty that makes companies rethink their decisions about investments (in California) he said. ??But for consumer groups the goal of all these investigations is straightforward. ??Certainly we're really hopeful that these investigations will lead to refunds for customers said TURN's Mindy Spatz. There is a widespread belief among people who follow these issues that widespread gaming and manipulation has occurred in the market. ??(c) 2001 The Orange County Register (Santa Ana Calif.). ??Visit the Register on the World Wide Web at http://www.ocregister.com/ JOURNAL-CODE: OC LOAD-DATE: May 29 2001 of 98 DOCUMENTS ?????????????????Copyright 2001 The Chronicle Publishing Co. ?????????????????????????The San Francisco Chronicle ?????????????????????MAY 29 2001 TUESDAY FINAL EDITION SECTION: NEWS Pg.

Those that weren't blamed it all on that most familiar of modern scapegoats the computer. ???Computers must be kept cool -- in the 60s for big mainframes and a bit more for the smaller units most folks use though some can go into the 80s without hiccuping. So generally people who work alongside the computers get to keep cool by association although it's the computer that counts. ???The ISO headquarters located in an industrial park 20 miles east of Sacramento is a delightfully cool and comfortable place when the outside temperature soars into the 90s and 100s. ???The reception area the only room accessible to the outraged public is a fairly stiff 76 degrees -- only two degrees cooler than the 78 degrees recommended by President Bush and the federal energy crisis czars and czarinas. ???But take a step past the lobby security doors and the temperature plummets. In the main hallway the temperature is 73 degrees. And in the control room where two dozen engineers and technicians sit at consoles and monitor the flow of California electricity on a giant diagram of state power lines so they can order blackouts for everyone else -- the temperature is 69 degrees. ???NO SWEATING AT ISO ???Some managers do not take off their sports coats and jackets. ???We want these people to be comfortable explained Tony Capasso facilities manager for the ISO complex. We don't want these people sweating bullets in the middle of a crisis. ???Inside the state Capitol where legislators and the governor preach compliance with federal guidelines calling for 78-degree thermostats the temperature dips into the high 60s. The coolest spots are the press briefing room and the treasurer's old office. ???GOVERNOR'S OFFICE ???The governor's suite is in the mid-70s apparently because folks are often coming by with thermometers and it wouldn't do not to set an example. Press secretary Steve Maviglio said Governor Gray Davis is a practice-what-he-preaches kind of guy who keeps corridors dark shades drawn air conditioners idle. His personal secretary works in short sleeves with a cheap plastic fan humming nearby. ???It's so dark in the hall that we're always bumping into things said one aide. ???Even so the temperature in the governor's suite of offices is three degrees cooler than the 78 degrees recommended by President Bush -- not the first time the two men have failed to agree. ???THE LEGISLATURE ???The Assembly chamber is 71 degrees while the Senate chamber -- with 40 fewer legislators spewing forth -- is 73 degrees. But the Senate chamber has a southern exposure one Capitol guide explained. ???Hot air from the people sitting inside has nothing to do with it he said. ???In San Francisco the temperature inside cavernous City Hall dips in spots to the mid-60s. College student Jasmine Westbrook who dropped by with her art class on a project to sketch the interior of the building was doing her sketching while wearing a windbreaker to keep warm. ???I want to stay comfortable she said. It think it's supposed to be hotter in here isn't it? ???The mayor's office at 73 degrees was eight degrees warmer than another office down the hall even without the mayor sitting in it. ???63 AT THE PUC ???At the headquarters of the state Public Utilities Commission which is supposed to be keeping an eye on the self-declared bankruptcy of the utility that mails out the bills the lobby temperature is 63 degrees. ???Chief engineer David Omosheyin eyeing The Chronicle's thermometer nervously insisted the 63-degree reading was caused by the lobby's proximity to the front door where the outside temperature at the moment was in the low 60s. He invited the thermometer to visit the upper floors where the temperature was 70. ???As for San Francisco's federal buildings: Bush would probably not frown. ???His orders appeared to be followed during The Chronicle's visits so much so that it was actually hotter inside than out. Though that wouldn't be hard considering it was in the low 60s outside. And the places measured happened to be courtrooms and tax offices where the body heat from anxiety alone could probably melt the paint some days. ???San Franciscans Omosheyin said are losing their perspective when it comes to things like electricity energy alerts and rolling blackouts. In his native country of Nigeria he said the electricity runs sporadically if at all. ???There the power can go off for a week he said. The world goes on. Here people take a lot of things for granted and electricity is one of them. ???As for the offices of the places that report on such matters they fared about the same. ???The Walnut Creek bureau of The Chronicle where the sun sizzles into the 90s with regularity in the summer is kept at 67 degrees because of all the computers.

Brad Sherman a Democrat from Thousand Oaks who met Air Force One on the tarmac at Los Angeles International Airport along with a group of high school students wasted no time button-holing the president for what appeared to be an animated conversation. ???I brought up . . . the idea that after his meeting with our governor I hoped he would be in favor of wholesale regulation (of energy prices) Sherman said later. He disagreed with me. ???Sherman -- who two weeks ago suggested that the headline to the president's national energy policy should be Bush to California: Drop Dead -- didn't seem optimistic yesterday about Bush's 48-hour visit to the state. I think that the president's policies show either a lack of understanding of what's really going on in California or a lack of concern he said. ???That vignette underscored some of the challenges facing Bush who arrived in California as protesters geared up and Democratic Gov. Gray Davis prepared to press him for federal action on the state's power troubles. ???Besides Sherman Bush was greeted by a crowd of cheering Republicans including Secretary of State Bill Jones and Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan the former a declared GOP candidate for governor in 2002 the latter a rumored one. ???But today Bush will sit down with the present governor who lately has been blistering in his criticism of the president. ???The last time I looked California was still part of the United States of America Davis told reporters this weekend. We have contributed disproportionately to the economic growth of this country. There's no reason why a president should not respond to a legitimate request from the chief executive of the largest state in the union. ???In his first visit to California since just before the election Bush plans to emphasize the energy crisis -- but will focus on it through the lens of his own energy plan. ???ENERGY SECRETARY ACTS ???Just hours before the president landed Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham ordered a speedup in planning to relieve a notoriously overloaded electricity transmission line in California. ???Abraham's holiday action was timed to provide a bit of positive news for Bush to announce in California. He ordered the Western Area Power Administration a 15-state marketing arm of the Energy Department to complete planning and seek outside financing to reduce the transmission bottleneck on California's Path 15 which connects the northern and southern parts of the state. ???This morning Bush will visit the Marine Corps base at Camp Pendleton near San Diego to underscore his conservation order for a 10 percent cut in energy usage in federal buildings and military facilities. ???In Los Angeles he will deliver a wide-ranging talk before the World Affairs Council and lead a discussion among business leaders about technological advances in energy conservation. ???Then he will head to Fresno and Sequoia National Park to press his initiative to improve national parks. Along the way protesters have vowed to provide a vocal commentary on Bush's energy and environmental policies. ???But the real drama of the trip will no doubt be the sit-down between Bush and Davis today. The governor pushed for a lengthy open meeting with Bush that would include testimony from officials and consumers affected by the energy crisis. Bush's camp announced Friday the meeting would be 20 to 30 minutes -- in private. ???Davis plans to outline steps the state has taken to alleviate the energy crisis and what it wants the federal government to do -- including implementing price caps on the wholesale cost of energy cost-based pricing and the possibility of ordering refunds. ???DAVIS THREATENING SUIT ???The governor has said he will consider suing the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission -- the agency charged with overseeing energy prices -- if it does not impose temporary price caps. ???And the state Legislature has already filed a suit saying the commission has failed to stop what it has determined are unjust and unreasonable prices. ???With California's energy woes worsening and a summer of rolling blackouts predicted the Bush-Davis session holds potentially deep political pitfalls for both leaders both of whom are suffering in state polls as a result of their handling of the energy crisis. ???Bush needs to demonstrate his concern for California a state that gave a 12-point margin of victory to Al Gore in the presidential election. ???But even as Bush adviser Karen Hughes told state reporters this week that the president had arrived to show he cares Vice President Dick Cheney again chastised state officials for delaying their response to the energy crisis because all of the action was potentially unpleasant. ???And Cheney signaled that the administration would resist long-term price caps saying We think that's a mistake. ???Such talk drew fire from Davis' senior political adviser Garry South who charged that Cheney's words demonstrated insensitivity to California's troubles and only underscored the perception of an all-oil all-the-time ticket. ???Davis whose campaign for re-election next year will depend on his handling of the crisis has stepped up his criticism of Bush and profit-hungry energy firms particularly those from Texas in recent weeks. ???And yesterday signaling no letup Davis' supporters made an unusual holiday conference call to again press his case for federal action. They argued that without immediate intervention from the Bush administration the economy of California -- and potentially the entire nation -- was at risk. ???'THIS ENORMOUS SHOCK' ???We have this enormous shock in prices that needs to be addressed and not ignored said Joseph Fichero head of Sabre Partners and a consultant to Davis. ???Alan Blinder a Princeton economist and former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve warned that energy woes in California alone would take almost a half a percent of the gross domestic product off of the national economy. ???Blinder and others argue that short-term relief -- for about 6 to 12 months -- is necessary while new power plants are being built. ???Most times and most places I agree price caps are not the long-run solution but they can be part of a short-term solution Blinder said. There really is a case for temporary price caps to shield consumers and the California and national economy from the full force of the energy shock. ???Limited new price caps approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on the sale of wholesale electricity begin today in California. But the temporary caps which go into effect when the electricity reserves dip below 7.5 percent have been lambasted by Davis as ineffective and inadequate. ???Political analysts say Bush's resistence on the issue could cost him in California -- and elsewhere. ???(California) is probably an area where he is criticized more than any other region in the country said Mark DiCamillo director of the statewide Field Poll.

Gray Davis will urge President Bush today to back a 2-year cap on electricity costs as the best way to keep his power-starved state -- and possibly the U.S. economy -- from sinking into recession. ???The Democratic governor and Republican president who have been sparring from afar over energy policy will meet here to discuss their differences. The White House has said repeatedly that it opposes price caps as a way to deal with energy shortages in California. ??In an interview with USA TODAY Davis said a limit on wholesale electricity costs is needed while the state attempts to build 15 new power plants. He said that would still allow a 30% profit margin. ??While the president didn't create this problem he is uniquely situated to solve it Davis said. I'll make clear that he has an opportunity to relieve the pain and give California the breathing space to put more plants online. ???Bush making his first visit to California as president unveiled a long-term energy policy this month that calls for increased production and to a lesser extent conservation. The president will promote conservation steps being taken by the federal government during a visit today to the Marine Corps base at Camp Pendleton. ??The president believes that imposing price caps will only make the problem worse White House spokesman Dan Bartlett said. ??Davis whose popularity has plummeted as Californians cope with blackouts to offset electricity shortages said his state's problems could hurt all Americans if they are not dealt with quickly. I'm asking for some form of relief that reduces the outrageous prices we're currently bearing he said. Without that relief lots of people will lose their businesses and California could well be dragged into a recession. Since we're about one-eighth of the national economy that doesn't bode well for America. ???The California Public Utilities Commission has announced rate increases of up to 50% for businesses and 37% for homes. ??Bush has sidestepped California after losing the state by 12 percentage points to Democrat Al Gore last year in the presidential election. But with Democrats targeting several GOP House members in next year's elections Republicans must go on the offensive or risk losing control of the closely divided House of Representatives. ??Davis a possible presidential candidate in 2004 said he wants to avoid rancor with Bush: I'm saying 'Look we got into this in a bipartisan way. We should get out of it in a bipartisan way.'

Gray Davis (D) on Tuesday. Bush's aides said he will pledge to cooperate with California but will stick to his position that no action by the federal government can prevent the rolling blackouts expected this summer. ???Abraham ordered the Western Area Power Administration a 15-state marketing arm of his department to complete planning and seek outside financing for an increase in transmission capacity that he said would be a big step in the right direction and a big step forward for Californians. ???California's electricity problems developed over a period of years and cannot be solved overnight Abraham said in a news release.

Today's action is designed to reduce the bottleneck on California's Path 15 which connects the northern and southern parts of the state. ???Davis who is seeking reelection next year has seen his poll ratings plummet as electricity prices soared utilities hit dire financial straits and homes and businesses were surprised with blackouts. ???Bush has taken several steps to try to encourage additional power generation in the state but has maintained since before he took office that California's problems were created here -- through a troubled effort at electricity deregulation and public opposition to construction of additional power plants -- and would have to be solved here. ???Davis plans to use the meeting to lobby Bush once again to endorse a cap by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on the wholesale price of electricity. Again and again the administration has said it will not take that step. ???This administration does not and will not support energy price controls Bush told a business audience in March. Price controls do not increase supply and they do not encourage conservation. Price controls contributed to the gas lines of the 1970s. And the United States will not repeat the mistake again. ???Davis energy advisers told reporters on a conference call today that without the cap California energy costs could be $ 50 billion higher this year than two years ago.

A03 LENGTH: 1936 words HEADLINE: It's Still Dawn for Solar Power in L.A. Despite City Subsidies Homeowners Hesitate to Install Expensive Alternative Energy Source BYLINE: William Booth Washington Post Staff Writer DATELINE: LOS ANGELES BODY: ???One year ago this city announced its intent to become the Solar Capital of the World with 100000 roofs covered with solar electric panels by the end of the decade an audacious goal to transform the homes of this smoggy but sunny metropolis into miniature power plants. ???To fulfill what is perhaps the nation's most ambitious solar campaign the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power began offering substantial buy down subsidies that would reimburse rate payers for half the price of each new solar energy system. For the average home a photovoltaic package costs between $ 10000 and $ 20000 parts and labor included before the rebate. ???How many have been installed? ???At last count about 40. ???That leaves only 99960 rooftops to go. ???The Bush administration and especially Vice President Cheney architect of its energy plan have been criticized for skepticism regarding alternative energy sources. But a close examination of the Los Angeles solar experiment and a review of similar programs suggest the former oilmen in the White House have a point: Solar at least has not proven ready for prime time. ???For all of Los Angeles's good intentions and for all of solar's many positive attributes the problems of harnessing its power remain. Some of those challenges are economic and some technological others are more mundane but often ignored such as finding a qualified contractor a homeowner can trust to drill dozens of holes in the roofs to mount the things. ???In a reprise of the 1980s solar again is hot. The price of photovoltaics is dropping and interest is growing. Other states such as New York Arizona Florida and Washington are moving to join California in major efforts to wire homes to draw power from the sun. ???But as many Americans are beginning to understand the delivery of energy is like a complex interconnected assembly line and the devil lurks in the details. ???The Los Angeles experiment tells the story shared by other locales. In L.A. for example the city's lone solar panel manufacturer has not been able to supply enough systems to meet demand. ???The systems too are often oversold by solar proponents. In the real world most do not pay for themselves in a few years as some advocates claim but take 20 years or more to return their initial cost in the form of reduced utility bills. ???Nor are the systems maintenance-free: At a minimum the rooftop panels must be routinely cleaned of pollution dust and leaves. ???They cannot be installed efficiently on homes without shade-free south-facing roofs the shadow from a neighbor's palm tree can frustrate the system's photovoltaic cells. ???Nor will the most common systems allow buyers to live off the grid unless they want to purchase a large bank of batteries. Even with the batteries homeowners probably would not be able to run their washing machines and air conditioners at the same time. ???It is not an economic proposition at this point conceded Terry Peterson a solar expert at Electric Power Research Institute in Palo Alto Calif. But one day Peterson predicts 100 years from now solar energy will provide a substantial percentage of the world's energy needs. In a decade or two the cost of solar will likely be competitive with other energy sources such as natural gas nuclear or coal. ???But now? It is still a luxury item. Like buying a swimming pool Peterson said. ???I really like the idea of running my house with solar power said Andrew Chin a potential customer in Los Angeles who has been researching a purchase. But they're still pretty expensive even with the rebates and so I gotta ask myself what am I doing this for his conscience or his wallet. I'm thinking I might wait until they work the kinks out. ???The most knowledgeable and experienced solar contractor in Los Angeles is probably Graham Owen the founder owner and single full-time employee of Go Solar Co. ???His installation of a one-kilowatt solar electric system on a home in the San Fernando Valley was the first to be awarded a rebate by the Los Angeles power department in March. ???How many systems has he installed as part of the rebate program? Three. ???But Owen is a true believer and over the next year he plans to cover hundreds of roofs with solar panels. On his shelf Owen still has an unreturned library book The Coming Age of Solar Energy published in 1963 and checked out from his high school in Lennox Hills Ill. in 1979. I guess we're still stuck in the coming age of solar energy he said smiling. He recalled that the buzz about solar water heaters in the 1980s led to disappointment with shoddy workmanship and less than spectacular energy savings. ???Until recently there has been little widespread interest in solar electric power. Since 1998 the California Energy Commission has been pushing its own program to encourage homeowners to erect photovoltaic panels on their roofs offering to subsidize about one-third of the cost. ???Across a state with a population of about 35 million only 450 solar energy systems have been installed on homes. ???Then the California energy crisis struck with its power interruptions and steep rate increases and the phone calls began to overwhelm Owen's voice mail. ???On days with rolling blackouts? I get a hundred calls maybe more Owen says. His Web site www.solarexpert.com is now receiving 3000 hits a day. Customers are begging him to do jobs. ???The Los Angeles power department reports a similar surge in interest since the energy crisis began six months ago. Customer demand has shot through the roof says Angelina Galiteva executive director for strategic planning at the Department of Water and Power. She estimates that her department receives 1000 calls on some days about its solar subsidy program. ???Yet while the reliability and cost of solar electric technologies continue to improve solar power today accounts for only a sliver of the national pie chart of energy production -- less than 1 percent. The country produces about 300 megawatts of electricity with solar -- about the same amount produced by a single mid-sized traditional power plant. ???The current trend for photovoltaics is not to erect large centralized solar farms in the desert an experiment that withered in the 1980s but to pursue distributed generation or individual units on scattered rooftops. ???The problem has consistently been the cost of the solar panels which has been too steep to justify them except for customers who are committed environmentalists or techies who like the elegance of the systems. ???Los Angeles began its solar experiment after Sacramento legislators mandated that utilities spend about 3 percent of their revenue on efficiency conservation and renewable energy. For solar the power department committed $ 75 million over the next five years -- enough to subsidize panels on 7500 homes. ???The power department will pay $ 5 for each watt of solar installed on a residence or business. Homeowners typically purchase a one-kilowatt or two- kilowatt (1000 or 2000 watts respectively) solar electric system meaning that the municipal utility would pay between $ 5000 and $ 10000 of the cost up front -- an enticing tax-free offer. ???For many years I wanted to do solar but it was so expensive said LaWanda Geary in the San Fernando Valley who in April had Owen install 32 panels for a two-kilowatt system on her sunny roof. The rebate really got me going. I don't know many times when the government offers to pay half of anything. ???The systems that are eligible for rebates must be tied into a utility's electric power grid meaning that during the day when the sun is shining the panels are adding a stream of electrons used by the home to run its lights and appliances. ???If there is a surplus of solar power that electricity goes back into the power lines and is passed along to a neighbor and the electric meter at the house actually runs backward. Homeowners however are not selling their excess electricity -- they're giving it away to the utility company. ???On cloudy days and at night the home is not being powered by solar energy but getting its electricity the traditional way from the power lines. ???Calculations on savings vary. A two-kilowatt solar system can supply an average-sized home with 20 to 80 percent of its electrical needs depending on how many lights appliances and air conditioners are running and how efficient they are. ???After the subsidy and depending on how the system is paid for (in cash or with borrowed funds) a solar system can pay for itself in as little as six years and as much as 36 years. Owen assumes about 20 years. ???Potential solar clients moreover often mistakenly assume that going with the sun will take them off the grid which is not possible without a large bank of batteries that costs several thousand dollars more. Because the solar panels are still wired to the power grid if there is a blackout the power in a solar house goes off just like everyone else's. If uninterrupted power is needed Owen suggests a diesel generator. ???Galiteva does cite one real advantage of solar: It reduces the electricity that must be purchased from power companies and protects to some degree a solar home from the full brunt of upwardly spiraling rate increases. Unfortunately for solar enthusiasts the L.A. Department of Water and Power which was not deregulated along with the three other major utilities in California has perhaps the cheapest and most stable supply of electricity in the state making the economic argument harder to make. ???To receive the full $ 5 per watt subsidy the L.A. Department of Water and Power requires a homeowner to purchase solar panels from a manufacturer based in the city. The idea is not only to become the solar capital of the world but also to encourage local growth of an emerging industry and create jobs. ???One hitch is that no solar panel makers were located in Los Angeles. ???After lengthy negotiations Siemens Solar Industries based in Camarillo Calif. an hour's drive to the north announced in February that it would open a solar panel manufacturing plant in Los Angeles. But it is not a complete facility: The L.A. plant does only some final assembly and then the units must be returned to Camarillo for final testing and shipping. ???Tina Nickerson a spokeswoman for Siemens Solar estimates her company has sold a couple dozen to L.A. homeowners for the rebate program. But she too reports that the interest from consumers is sometimes overwhelming and that supply has been a problem. Most U.S.-manufactured units are shipped overseas to places such as Germany Japan and Scandinavia which have had generous subsidies in place for years. ???LaWanda Geary had to call Siemens herself to push them to deliver panels for her house -- and she was eligible for the rebate because of a stopgap compromise that allows to Siemens to ship solar panels from Camarillo until its L.A. plant is fully operational. ???Everyone involved concedes there have been bottlenecks. Siemens now says it has enough panels to begin to meet demand and Owen and the city are hoping things will sort themselves out especially if more solar manufacturers are drawn to Los Angeles. But proponents worry about what will happen when the subsidies run out. ???Selling solar is now the easy part Owen says. I could sell a hundred a week. It's getting them up on the roof that's the hard part. LOAD-DATE: May 29 2001 of 98 DOCUMENTS ????????????????Copyright 2001 News World Communications Inc.

A6 LENGTH: 1264 words BYLINE: Greg Pierce THE WASHINGTON TIMES BODY: ??TAKING YOUR MEDICINE ??Oakland Mayor Jerry Brown who was once governor of California likens current Gov. ?Gray Davis' handling of the electricity crisis to his own bungling of the medfly crisis. ??Here's an analogy to the medfly crisis Mr. ?Brown said in an interview with the Los Angeles Times' Douglas Foster. ?When I first heard about the medfly I said 'Well it's just a few flies maybe they'll go away. ?Maybe they won't keep reproducing.' And the winter came and they stopped reproducing. ?And then somewhere around February or March I learned about something called 'spring emergence.' As the ground got warmer the larvae turned into flies and more medflies started appearing. It got out of hand and ultimately I had to order malathion spraying. ?It would have been better had I taken forceful action at the first notice of the medfly. ??Mr. ?Foster asked: Are you saying that the governor missed opportunities to act early in the same way? ??Mr. ?Brown replied: There's an analogy there. ?I didn't want to spray because I knew the people in Santa Clara County didn't want to have helicopters spraying malathion over their homes. ?It didn't sound good. ?As governor I wouldn't have wanted to see rate increases either. ?But sometimes you have to take your medicine early. ?It's less bitter than if you postpone it. ??Mr. ?Davis served as Mr. ?Brown's chief of staff when the latter Democrat was governor. ??ENERGETIC CRITICISM ??President Bush's energy plan already under fire from Democrats and environmentalists is dismissed by National Review the conservative magazine as so much political posturing. ??The hyperbolic attacks on the Bush plan by environmentalists (as an attempt to poison the air and kill the caribou) shouldn't trick conservatives into an exaggerated sense of its merit the magazine says in an editorial in its current issue dated June 11. ??The basic thrust of the administration's thinking on energy is sound: a growing economy requires more energy which in turn entails more production. But the Bush plan itself is a political document meant to placate corporate interests environmentalists and everyone in between and so is festooned with an embarrassment of subsidies and incentives that will at best prove an irrelevance. ??As Jerry Taylor of the Cato Institute writes in this issue the phantom energy crisis is already healing itself. ?Power plants are being built at a rate that outpaces Dick Cheney's benchmark of one plant a week. Altogether almost 100000 new daily megawatts of electrcity capacity are scheduled to be available nationwide by next year. ?This is twice the amount of electricity that California now uses on an average day. ?While Cheney has been sitting with his advisers around a White House conference table investors and entrepreneurs have been digging building and refining his energy problem into oblivion. ?By the time all the Bush plan's tax credits have kicked in there may well be an energy glut. ?All of this is thanks to the most efficient energy plan known to man: market pricing. ??WRONG ON BOTH COUNTS ??The buzz in the media after Sen. ?James Jeffords' switch put Democrats in control of the Senate was that President Bush must change his ways. ?He has to become more moderate. ?Why? ?Because only that will prevent more Republican defections and it's the president's one hope for getting his agenda through Congress. ?This is wrong on both counts Fred Barnes writes in the Weekly Standard. ??Bush and GOP congressional leaders bent over backwards to accommodate Jeffords and liberal Democrats on education the senator's top priority. Jeffords bolted anyway. ?On taxes Bush stuck with his conservative tax cut until nearly the end when he compromised just enough to assure passage. Jeffords voted with him Mr. ?Barnes said. ??The truth about the impact of Jeffords' move is that no political earthquake has occurred. ?The Senate is ideologically unchanged. ?The swing votes in the Senate including John McCain are important but they already were. ?There's no clear path to victory for the Bush agenda after taxes and education but that was always true. ?To pass a patients' bill of rights a prescription-drug benefit or missile defense a bipartisan coalition of some sort will be essential. ??Yes there's one big change with Democrats taking over: judges. ?Bush will have a harder time getting conservative nominees through a Senate Judiciary Committee run by Patrick Leahy perhaps the most partisan Democrat on Capitol Hill. ?One more downbeat side effect: Jeffords' announcement overshadowed Bush's tax-cut victory denying him any political momentum he might have gotten from it. ??INCOHERENT REBEL ??Before liberals put James Jeffords on Mount Rushmore can we please stop and note how he's already betrayed Democrats and his own avowed principles by deciding that his defection won't take effect until after President Bush's wrongheaded tax cut has been signed into law? syndicated columnist Matthew Miller writes. ??Any traitor (I mean 'man of conscience') worth his salt shoves the knife in to the hilt - otherwise what's the point? ?Machiavellis throughout history have wisely advised that when you move against the king you'd better finish him off Mr. ?Miller said. ??Yet Jeffords took pains to make sure his switch wouldn't derail the centerpiece of Bush's agenda the very agenda that inspired Jeffords' move and which Jeffords had the power to stop via his action. ??We are dealing in other words with a deeply incoherent rebel. ?This would be a private matter for Jeffords to sort out with his therapist were not his cowardice in this moment of 'courage' so consequential for the country. ??THE LONELY VERMONTER ??In the final analysis Vermont Sen. ?James M. ?Jeffords was out of step with his party making his departure appropriate if politically inconvenient. ?Those who argue that it was the party out of step with Jeffords some political analysts are saying are those who wish the Republicans no good. UPI political analyst Peter Roff writes. ??The conservative low-tax minimal-government Republican Party enjoys national parity with the Democrats something the Northeastern liberal GOP could not achieve. ?Jeffords is in that regard these observers say out of step with victory. ?One GOP consultant went so far as to say 'If the Republicans were doing better in New England Jeffords would not have been so lonely. ?Why is it that the people from states where the GOP usually doesn't win think they can tell the rest of us how to run the party and what we all should believe? ?It doesn't make sense.' (spade) ??There are those in the GOP who regret the loss of the majority that Jeffords' defection brings but very few if any are mourning the loss of the lonely Vermonter Mr. ?Roff said. ??LAST WORDS ??Brill's Content asked PR pros how they would handle Vice President Richard B. Cheney's heart problems. ??It's inconceivable that Mr. ?Cheney can put in the kind of time we're led to believe he is without putting himself at risk one public relations man John Scanlon told the magazine. ?My recipe for controlling the situation would be photo-ops access to his schedule and a couple of exclusive articles. ?He's got to convince people he's fit for the job. ??Unfortunately Mr. ?Scanlon did not live to see his quote in the magazine's June issue the New York Post reports. ?He died of a heart attack. ??* Greg Pierce can be reached at 202/636-3285 or by e-mail at gpierce@washingtontimes.com.

Both Mr. Bush and Vice President Richard B. ?Cheney who on Friday again blamed the state government of California for the energy crunch oppose cap measures. ??In his first visit to California since the presidential election where he lost the state to former Vice President Al Gore by 54 percent to 41 percent Mr. Bush hopes to sell his national energy policy to a vocal group of opponents. But the hue and cry has been muted of late since residents have battled rolling blackouts and sky-high gasoline prices. ??A new poll released Friday shows 59 percent of Californians many of whom have been longtime foes of nuclear energy now believe the non-polluting energy source may be the way to solve the state's problems. ??Mr. ?Davis' popularity has plummeted. ?The Democrat facing re-election next year and often mentioned as a presidential candidate is viewed as having poor job performance by 60 percent of Californians according to a survey by the Public Policy Institute of California. ??In a small gesture to California Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham yesterday announced plans to increase transmission capacity in California which he said would be a big step in easing rolling power blackouts. ??Abraham ordered the Western Area Power Administration - an Energy Department arm responsible for marketing electricity from federal water projects in 15 Western states - to wrap up planning for building extra transmission capacity. ??The governor has repeatedly blamed Mr. ?Bush who took office four months ago for the energy crunch in California. ?He points the finger of blame far outside the state's boundaries primarily at Washington and Mr. Bush's home state. ??The people that have dropped the ball are the federal government Mr. Davis said last week. ?They need to reimpose a price cap because we're being obscenely gouged by price gougers out of Texas and the Southwest. ?. . . There's a massive transfer of wealth going on from ordinary citizens in California to Texas. ??Mr. ?Davis has also charged that utility companies are withholding power in order to drive up prices a claim the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has investigated and dismissed. ??Mr. ?Bush and Mr. ?Cheney have often pointed out that California is second only to Rhode Island in conservation efforts but the state is on the brink of an energy supply collapse. ??Still despite the state's failure to build new power plants Mr. Davis says California is entitled to a federal bailout approved by Mr. Bush. ??I'm going to keep asking him to do it because we're part of America. The state the last three years has led American economic growth. ?. . . We're doing everything we can out here he said. ??In the Democratic response to the president's weekly radio address Mr. Davis accused the president a former oil man of being concerned only with the petroleum magnates. ??With all due respect I urge you to stand up to your friends in the energy business and exercise the federal government's exclusive responsibility to ensure that energy prices are reasonable he said. ??Many analysts however blame the state's deregulation scheme and failure to construct adequate electrical generating capacity. ?The price wholesale power providers can charge utilities is not capped but the fee those companies can charge users is capped - resulting in massive debt for providers. ??The state was slow to respond to increased demand the analysts say even though the state is building 10 new power plants four of which will come on line this summer. ??In his national energy policy Mr. ?Bush lays out 105 proposals that focus on increasing domestic supply improving the nation's ability to move energy between regions and increased conservation. ?But the policy is geared more toward long-term solutions - such as decreasing America's reliance on foreign oil - than short-term relief for Californians and motorists nationwide. ??Mr. ?Cheney who heads the president's energy task force and said Friday that California knew for more than a year about the impending energy shortage has promoted nuclear power as essential to America's energy needs. ?He said that at least some of the 65 power plants that need to be built annually to meet future electricity demand ought to be nuclear. ??A poll by the Field Institute last week found many Californians now agree. Although nuclear energy produces 20 percent of the nation's energy California has just two nuclear plants.

We live it every day in the comforts of peace and the gifts of freedom. ??Bush also laid a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknowns. ??Later he traveled to Mesa Ariz. to pay tribute to veterans at the Champlin Fighter Aircraft Museum. He asked the crowd to observe a nationwide moment of silence at 3 p.m. Arizona time. ??Any foe who might challenge our national resolve will be repeating the grave error of defeated adversaries the president said. ??Bush opened the day at the White House where he signed legislation to construct a World War II monument on the National Mall a setting criticized by some. Bush said the monument between the Washington Monument and Lincoln Memorial will stand for the ages. ??I will make sure the monument gets built the president told an audience of veterans in the yellow-curtained East Room among them former Sen. Bob Dole (R-Kan.) who has supported the memorial. ??. GRAPHIC: PHOTOPHOTO (color): President Bush and Maj. Gen. James T.

Gray Davis doesn't want to hear: He won't force down soaring electricity prices that have cost California nearly $8 billion since January. ??The Republican president and the embattled Democratic governor arranged a 20-meeting Tuesday to talk about California's energy crisis but there was no indication they would break their stalemate. ??Bush opposes price limits on wholesale electricity that utilities buy arguing they do nothing to address supply-and-demand issues at the heart of the crisis. ??Davis contends federal energy regulators are ignoring their mandate to ensure just and fair electricity prices. ??With no sign of a break in the deadlock each side maneuvered for maximum advantage from Bush's first full day in California as president. ??Davis in an interview Tuesday on ABC's Good Morning America defended his record on licensing more power plants. ??We've licensed 15 plants. Ten are under construction four will be online this summer four next summer and by the end of 2003 we will have built our way out of this problem. But between now and then we are getting gouged unbelievably Davis said. ??The Bush administration timed positive energy announcements to coincide with the president's visit. ??At the Marine Corps base at Camp Pendleton Bush was announcing the expansion of a program that provides federal money to help low-income residents pay for power. ??Bush was proposing $150 million in addition to $300 million already budgeted for a component of the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program to provide special help to cash-strapped residents of California and certain Midwest areas such as Chicago a senior administration aide said. ??Bush was also reminding state residents of his order that military facilities in the state cut peak-hour usage by 10 percent. ??To alleviate an electricity bottleneck on a crucial south-north transmission path the Department of Energy announced that the Western Area Power Authority will try to raise money from a variety of private and public entities to finance a crucial additional lines. ??The Bush administration is taking a leadership role in addressing a long-neglected problem in California's electricity transmission system said Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham. California's electricity problems developed over a period of years and cannot be solved overnight. However we can move now on actions that will help avert the same types of problems from recurring year after year. ??Davis had a letter for Bush from top economists who maintain price caps are justified and necessary. ??Aides to the governor expressed amazement that Bush would travel all the way to California with no major announcement in hand and predicted Davis would respond with polite rage. ??Mindful of the national stage he commanded Davis planned a news conference to air his grievances. And he convened a panel of families he said have been victimized by the energy crisis in the same hotel where Bush was staying. ??Davis wants Bush to pressure the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to impose stiff price caps. ??Tuesday limited caps ordered last month by FERC go into effect in California but only when electricity reserves fall below 7.5 percent in the state - a step Davis called inadequate. ??Protesters planned demonstrations in Los Angeles and at Camp Pendleton in San Diego County. ??Bush also arranged a speech on energy and trade to the Los Angeles World Affairs Council and planned to president over a closed-door energy round-table discussion.

Gray Davis was to meet President Bush to press for a federal cap on energy prices. ??But Davis wasn't expected to win any concessions during the 20-minute Tuesday meeting where he's expected to point to Texas energy makers. ??Davis has appeared on national news programs attacking Bush for opposing price controls on wholesale electricity and suggesting the president has ignored price-gouging by Texas-based electricity generators. ??The president did not create this problem but he is uniquely situated to solve it Davis said Monday. What I'm going to ask him to do with all respect is to enforce federal law. The money that leaves this state goes directly to energy companies in Texas and the Southwest. ??If Bush refuses to administer price controls as expected Davis can use that as ammunition in his sparring with the administration. ??Bush has blamed California officials for the state's power woes and said price controls won't solve shortages. Instead they said Bush plans to stress his efforts to conserve energy in federal buildings and will bring one or two new initiatives to the table. ??One of them commits the federal government to helping organize a consortium to build more power lines for the state. ??Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham directed the Western Area Power Administration a federal agency to take the first steps to clear the way for building more transmission capacity between southern and northern California. That would help relieve a transmission bottleneck in the central part of the state. ??While this will not help this summer Abraham said in a statement the line improvements when completed will help avert the same types of problems from recurring year after year. ??The stakes of the meeting are high for both politicians. ??Davis who has been mentioned as a Democratic challenger to Bush in 2004 wants federal help to solve an energy crunch that threatens rolling outages this summer and has cost state taxpayers nearly $8 million since January - the price of buying power for two cash-starved private utilities. And his plan to rescue one of those companies reportedly is faltering. ??Leaders of both the state Senate and Assembly oppose a $3 billion-plus plan to bail out Southern California Edison by buying its power lines the Los Angeles Times reported Monday. ??Bush meanwhile needs to mend fences in vote-heavy California. The Republican president lost badly here in November and polls show most Californians dislike his handling of their energy crisis. ??Bush's Tuesday agenda was heavy on energy issues. At the Marine Corps base at Camp Pendleton near San Diego Bush was to highlight his order that federal agencies and installations cut back energy use. Then it was on to Los Angeles to discuss his energy plan in a speech to the Los Angeles World Affairs Council. ??Bush was confronted by the issue virtually as he stepped off the plane Monday in Los Angeles. Rep. Brad Sherman D-Los Angeles escorted the Academic Decathlon national championship team from El Camino Real High School in Woodland Hills to meet Bush. He told the president California needs regulation of electric generators. ??The president seems to believe just by instinct that rate regulation reduces supply and also by instinct that all those in the energy industry are fair people who are not trying to game the system Sherman said. Anyone who studies the facts in California knows that power is being withheld in order to drive up the price.

We're bleeding in the sand. ?We need a tourniquet and the president is the one that can do this. ??GERSTEIN: (VO) During his trip President Bush plans to highlight the federal government's conservation efforts but aides say he will not endorse price caps. ??Mr. TUCKER ESKEW (Director White House Media Affairs): The president believes that capping wholesale prices would do nothing to lower demand or increase supply the two fundamental solutions to any energy problem such as this. ??GERSTEIN: Holding the line against price caps may have political costs. Most analysts give Mr. Bush little chance of winning California in 2004 but Republican congressmen there face re-election next year. ?So far five of them have endorsed some kind of limit on electricity pricing. ??Representative RANDY CUNNINGHAM (Republican California): We're in an extreme emergency right now. ?It takes extreme measures. ??Unidentified Woman: We are in rolling blackouts. ??GERSTEIN: (VO) While electricity may be in very short supply in California this summer the president and politicians of all stripes are likely to find there's more than enough voter anger to go around. ?Josh Gerstein ABC News the White House.

366,Protecting Confidential Information,The exciting cocktail of credit derivatives and Enron Online raises significant novel legal risks for Enron. As most of you will by now know probably the most significant risk would arise in a situation where Enron has confidential information about a reference entity and wrongfully uses that information in pricing the credit derivative on that entity. This could well result in legal proceeding against Enron. In practice an allegation of misuse of confidential information can be very difficult indeed to defend without adequate procedures in place to safeguard that information. In fact Enron's credit trading will as you know rely strictly on publicly available financial information and will not involve the use of confidential information unless the reference entity has specifically consented. Nevertheless to avoid the appearance of impropriety we are taking additional steps to consider confidentiality agreements we have in place with potential reference entities before deciding whether or not we will quote prices on such entities. Against this background is the ever-present risk of insider dealing. This crime - which in the UK carries a maximum prison sentence of 7 years and an unlimited fine - is committed where a person (or member of their family etc) deals in the securities (shares bonds or derivatives on them) of a listed company on the basis of unpublished (confidential) price-sensitive information. We do not expect at this time to deal in publicly traded bonds as part of EnronCredit.com but insider dealing is relevant to the conduct of Enron staff and could affect other parts of our business. In addition SFA rules in the UK require the safeguarding of confidential information the misuse of which is a serious disciplinary matter. In order to ensure the success of this new business and that confidential information is not misused either by Enron or its staff we are now introducing important new policies and procedures in Europe and in the US. These procedures have been drawn up specifically for your credit trading group by lawyers in London Houston and New York and are attached. Please familiarise yourself and any future member of the group with these procedures. Once you have read and understood the attached procedures each one of you is required to confirm this to me in writing (or by note mail). Please note that similar procedures have been distributed to the key business heads in Europe who may have confidential information about reference entities (similar procedures are being disrtibuted to US business heads). This requires them to safeguard confidential information and to abide by the Restriced List procedure described below. Nevertheless you should treat your group as being within a Chinese Wall and see it as your personal responsibility not to solicit or accept from anyone in Enron information about reference entities which may be confidential. Thank you for your co-operation in implementing these important new procedures. I look forward to receiving your confirmation mentioned above (which is also described in the procedures).

My friend = Ol=01 Dave in Houston has trouble understanding the workings of our power business here in California. In fact so do I. Yesterday=01s Joint Senate/Assembly Committee on Energy and Natural Resources did nothing to improve either Dave=01s or my understanding of the national embarrassment California is perpetrating with electricity deregulation. =01&The next thing you know they will be taking property and forcing utilities to build power plants and transmission=018 he mused between sips of Dixie longneck beer and chomps of jalapeno peppers. =01&Come to think of it Dave they did say something about that. Yeah=018 I recalled =01&Senator Peace was expounding on his favorite idea which is forcing the ISO or the utilities to build peakers and not let the market build them. I can=01t remember if that was before or after he suggested to EOB Chairman Kahn that the ISO and the PX should be folded into State agencies under the direction of the Electric Oversight Board.=018 I know what you are thinking right now. The next thing you know California will have regulated retail rates. That recipe should be out of the PUC=01s oven sometime next week. =01&Well the power marketers are jigging the system bidding up to the ISO=01s bid cap. There is no way you can tell me that a generator planned to make $750/MWH in its pro forma=018 Dave added. =01&So you agree with Herr (Hair) Peace! You don=01t believe in markets=018 I retorted. = =01&Oh I believe in them but I remember when I was short on a 300 MW trade and without any notice or advanced warning the price in the Midwest market went against me=018 Dave recalled. =01&I called everyone who I tra= ded with and they had nothing. I finally called XXXXX and I asked what will it cost for 50 MW?=018 =01&Why didn=01t you ask for 300?=018 I wondered. =01&I didn=01t want to= show him my position. You get hosed when you show the buyer your position. Ask for 50 first=018 Dave chided. =01&What happened?=018 =01&Oh they offered to sell for $150/MWH. I said I= =01d take it and then said I needed another fifty. He asked $300. I took that and he priced the next 50 MW at $600=018 lamented Dave. =01&He just wanted to see how far he could push me. That=01s what I mean when I say the traders are jigging it.=018 =01&But Dave you old communist your forgetting the trading function is what mitigates the risk. The traders are the in between people who guess at the price. Sometimes they guess right and sometimes they guess wrong. But the damage or the reward is on their book not passed on to the ultimate consumer. It has nothing to do with the marginal cost of a generating plant.=018 And there you have it. Put in a price cap and the traders have a target for which to shoot. I can=01t prove the following yet but I=01l= l wager with any of you that as the price cap level dips down the average trading price climbs even as the so-called =01&dysfunctional=018 price spik= es are eliminated. Consumers get hosed and the fundamental economic principle is upheld which is one can never be made better off with the imposition of an additional constraint. I feel better already. Here is what is on our short agenda this week. >>> Things in the Mailbag >>> Things in the People=01s Republic of California @@@ The ISO Replies to the EOB Report @@@ Reflections on a Day of Senate Hearings @@@ PUC Issues OII on Functioning of Wholesale Market >>> Odds & Ends (_!_) >>> Things in the Mailbag It has been awhile since we put the mail feedbag on and had a munch. Here is what my friends have been writing me. FPL Energy=01s Steve Ponder was only too quick to tell me =01&Please Gary=  no more whining about your computer. How old are you?? Is this the year you get the AARP letter??? A very depressing moment. Do you really not know how to spell Morro Bay??? Please let us know what is going on with your son's hockey team?? Don't forget the cigars for Moron??? Bay!!!!=018 It is good to have friends like Steve. They make the pain of separation so much easier. And Steve when you FPL guys get that Entergy merger sorted out in a dozen years or so you let us know. I want to participate in the name selection for the new entity. How about Fentergy PLus? Next from the PX=01s Mark Hoppe who writes =01&As you've heard from others I don't know quite how you manage to knock out all this material each week. The burrito is informative humorous and usually contains a sprinkle of irony tragedy (ISO Drama). Though you are usually neutral regarding the PX you are not unduly negative which I appreciate. I think we do a pretty good job over here and so often people in the industry forget the amount effort and challenge it took the PX to successfully open this market.=018 Thanks Mark. I just want you to know that my ability to write this stuff every week is not constrained by the facts or evidence. I have learned from watching Herr (Hair?) Peace that as long as you can talk (write too) fast and have conviction in your statements regardless of how groundless they may be you will have a willing and eager audience. A few weeks ago I received from the PX=01s Jennifer Sherwood a note which she wants you to know are her opinions not necessarily the PX=01s. It=01s okay Jennifer. I paid Georgeyesterday the $20 I owed him for that sham Rose Bowl bet (remember? Stanford lost) and your opinions are cool with us. =01&Just curious - has anyone been comparing high unleaded prices to high CA electricity prices? What I mean is we are up in arms about how we should protect the unfortunate San Diego consumer who can't afford to keep the AC on. But what about the inflated unleaded gas prices the whole country has seen over the last few months? No effort is made by the government to shield the consumer from how much it costs to fill their gas tank. No mention is made of those who can't afford to drive to the grocery store because they can't afford the extra 15 or 20 cents a gallon. The costs are passed along to the consumer without pause. Granted there are differences between the unleaded market and the electricity market in terms of demand-side responsiveness but then again is it that much different to say =01+I can't drive today because gas is too expensive=01 vs. =01+I can't turn up the AC today because it's too expensive.=01=018 Finally from one of our [secret] Washington readers and I am not telling who I received the following: =01&I ... broke down and listened to the [ISO Governing Board] discussion and vote. Ugh! I too noted that the speak fast was applied to everyone but Herr Peace. My goodness what a mess we have. I loved Jerry's picture in USA Today -- it spoke volumes. My sources at FERC tell me though that we should keep an eye out for {FERC Chairman] Hoecker to do something really ... [Censored] ... for political reasons. Given no Commission meetings til September the only way to act is by unanimous consent so I would hope he can't do all that much.=018 >>> Things in the People=01s Republic of California @@@ The ISO Replies to the EOB Report Several of you people commented to me that the ISO=01s reply to the PUC/EOB report was very good. I decided to excerpt the best sections of it for the Burrito. The full document can be found on the ISO=01s website. =01&... the [PUC/EOB] Report asserts that the suspected activities of certain generators on June 13 created frequency instability leading to the Bay Area blackouts the following day. In fact the events of June 13 and June 14 were completely independent of one another. The voltage instability on June 14 was caused by system conditions on that day alone -- exceptionally high loads insufficient generation in the specific local area and transmission constraints that prevented the import of generation from outside the area. =01&The Report states that the ISO =01&never tried=018 to call upon consume= rs to reduce demand in order to avoid the Bay Area blackouts. In fact the ISO had in place on June 14 a number of demand response programs designed to reduce load including the Summer 2000 Demand Response Program under which customers have agreed through a prior solicitation to curtail energy use in exchange for a fee =01&The Report makes a number of assertions concerning the prices paid by =01+purchasers=01 of energy as a result of the recent price spikes (e.g. $= 1.2 billion in the month of June alone). These assertions leave one with the mistaken impression that these prices reflect amounts actually paid by the UDCs and/or passed through to customers. However in determining the total cost of energy one must determine the impact of any forward contracts entered into by the UDCs in advance of the wholesale energy markets. These contracts which are designed to =01&lock-in=018 a specific price in advance of real-time or near real-time market activities are specifically designed to mitigate the impact of price volatility and are standard in all commodities markets. We have reason to believe that some of the UDCs were substantially hedged during the period of the recent price spikes. =01&In a similar vein the reports asserts that California =01&might well= =018 have saved $110 million dollars had a $250 price cap been in place in May and June. This assertion assumes that all energy purchases would have been made at or below the $250 bid cap. In fact during times of peak demand when all of the state=01s generation has been exhausted the ISO competes with neighboring regions for available generation. In order to secure the necessary power the ISO must purchase on a bilateral basis this energy from resources located outside of the ISO=01s control area. =01&The Report asserts that California power markets =01&are not now competitive=018 and implies erroneously in our view that this is the normal state of affairs. It is not. The Market Surveillance Committee has noted that =01&market power in the California energy market appears to arise primarily during periods of peak demand=018 and warned that demand growth would increase the incidence of market power during the summer of 2000. =01&The Report asserts that the ISO is answerable only to a self-interested board and not to the citizens of California. This simply is not the case. The ISO is subject to the provisions of the Federal Power Act and to the rules and regulations of FERC which dictate in part that wholesale energy rates must be just and reasonable and in the public interest. The ISO further operates under a detailed tariff reviewed and approved by FERC. Every change to our market design and virtually every aspect of the ISO=01s business is subject to review and scrutiny by FERC. The FERC process provides substantial opportunities for input by the state agencies and such agencies have in fact been active participants in the FERC proceedings. =01&The Report asserts that California supply conditions have been affected by restructuring and that somehow the restructuring choices have made California more vulnerable to supply shortages. This assertion is unfounded. Significant load growth in California and neighboring states coupled with a lack of significant infrastructure investment in both generation and transmission have caused this vulnerability. Restructuring has increased proposed power plant applications many fold. Only by immediate and sustained attention to streamlining approval and siting processes for both of these critical infrastructure elements will this significant shortage be addressed.=018 >>> Things in the People=01s Republic of California @@@ Reflections on a Day of Senate Hearings If you want to imagine a scary sight imagine then twelve California legislators gathering together in one hearing room to rectify the wrongs of electric restructuring. Also imagine as if you are in the Twilight Zone witnesses that are slow on their feet and reckless in their facts. Then you get a glimpse of what yesterday=01s Joint Senate/Assembly hearing was like. It started over two hours late. The Senate was busy congratulating one of their own who is term-limited out next session and they wanted to heap on the glory. That said the show began with CEC Commissioner Bill Keese. Mr. Keese has one story and regardless how well he tells it and he does it is always the same story. It is the heat storm story. One can imagine in the heat storm story a lead character who is a single-mom call her Lady-Bird Bowen who travels across an angry land with her precocious pre-teen child Stevie Wonderboy. They are searching for electric power plants in the dessert which by the grace of God have been shipped to other countries which have more liberal returns on investment. Being the first speaker Mr. Keese took at least half the heat (storm) of the day. The rage of the Energy Fuhrer was palpable. Last week San Diegans shed 350 MW of load last week to save the entire system and did not receive one penny of compensation (I=01m not making that up ... He said it). He is sick of hearing about demand management as being a solution for the problem over the last five years and he is about done listening. People in San Diego are depressed by the sudden price hikes. Yikes! Keese did mention that the California reserve margin has sunk to 7% but in neighboring Arizona the reserve margin is -1% or -2%!! Mr. Keese correctly pointed out that electric power is not solely a California problem it is a regional problem. One member of the Committee asked what the legislature could do to speed up the power plant siting and construction process? Keese referred to Governor Gray Davis=01 Executive Order issued last week to which the CEC plans to respond soon date uncertain that lays out a 6 month permitting time line. The six months are enough if the applicant has the land secured zoning okayed transmission access and air offsets. Hmmmmmm. That alone might take six months before you get to the CEC. The next panel included Mr. Kahn of the EOB and Ms. Lynch. I went too hard on her last week calling her Let=01s Do Lynch. That was a 0.8 TPC. Sorry. I promise to be nicer starting now. The Energy Fuhrer instructed Ms. Lynch to use her authority to order SDG&E to divert the pass through of funds from the customers to the PX until the dysfunction of the market is cured. Put it in an escrow account. Ms Lynch promised to review this option at her August 21 PUC Meeting where she will enact SDG&E rate caps (told you). The star of the day I thought was FERC General Counsel Doug Smith. Mr. Smith comes to Sacramento. Isn=01t that a switch? Mr. Smith came in place of Mr. Hoecker thank the Lord. Mr. Smith put into FERC-eese what these 12 legislators could not get through their heads any other way. The 12 angry legislators were looking for a way for FERC to declare the wholesale market as non-competitive and then ask the generators to give back the money they over collected. When can we do that? Mr. Smith answered as only a FERC attorney can answer. There is a process. It takes time. You must have evidence. FERC uses a three-part criteria for assessing whether or not market based rates are allowable. It=01s based on market concentration and dominance not the existence of high prices. You would have to sue FERC in federal court and the best you could hope for is for FERC to reconsider its decision upon remand from the US Court of Appeals. Slowly the wind came out of the sails of the gang of 12. They were stumped. Herr (Hair?) Peace screamed couldn=01t you Mr. Smith of FERC today use your authority to declare the markets non-competitive that generators who had market based rates have exercised market power and retro-actively implement a $250 rate cap across the Western region? Like a wheezing accordion Mr. Smith played back and forth the familiar strains of music like a solo street musician on the corner. Back and forth: the process the process the process. There have been times in the past I hated the process at FERC. Today I have a renewed respect for what process affords me and you ... Freedom from the tyranny of a mob. For the remainder of the hearing they focused on remedies that could be undertaken by the PUC. >>> Things in the People=01s Republic of California @@@ PUC Issues OII on Functioning of Wholesale Market Well the official title is =01&Order Instituting Investigation into the Functioning of the Wholesale Electric Market and Associated Impact on Retail Electric Rates in the Services Territory of San Diego Gas & Electric Company=018. I like my title better. This Order or OII was issued at the last business meeting of the Commission on August 3.

Mr. Skilling's office is hesitant to allocate more than two hours without your recommendation. Emerson is being persistent. The key players from Emerson are David Farr newly appointed CEO and James Berges President and effectively the leader of Emerson's strategic development effort. It is anticipated that both would attend the meeting. Emerson execs want to (i) get to know Mr. Skilling and other senior management (ii) discuss mutual business opportunities and (iii) hold a discussion about the transformation of Enron from a pipeline company to its current form. The last point has to do with Emerson's continuing self-transformation effort and how Enron achieved its transformation. I need your advice and recommendation. Please respond by e-mail or telephone (x5-4040). Background: Emerson initiated this latest round of contact with Enron in November 2000 when Mike Train and Mark Proudfoot both Emerson VPs of Corporate Development visited the Enron building hosted by Steve Kean. I met them at that time. Since that initial meeting Emerson has aggressively pursued a business joint venture as preferred supplier with Martin Wenzel and the distributed power business I believe with promising results. My sense is that Emerson is uniquely positioned as EES' partner in that business. I am waiting to receive an update from Martin. Emerson is also interested in becoming a preferred supplier for EES's DSM business. While we generally support that idea we are pressing Emerson to reciprocate by becoming a customer of our bundled outsource business. Emerson is highly decentralized and our efforts to date have been unsuccessful. I want to use the meeting as an opportunity to press Emerson to consider a proposal from EES's bundled outsource business. Please let me know your recommendation on this matter.

379,House Energy Committee Passes First Energy Package,Late this morning the House Energy and Commerce Committee adoped the committee print as amended of an energy package that addresses conservation clean coal renewables hydro nuclear and boutique fuels. The vote was 50 to 5 to report the bill. Other committees -- Ways and Means Science and Resources -- also moved their energy bills this week. Thus the House is on track to consider a merged package before the start of the August Recess on August 3rd. As to electricity during the several days of debate this week both Chairmen Tauzin and Barton reaffirmed their intention to next move to electricity issues. Mr. Barton's staff advised me this morning that the subcommittee he chairs will hold a hearing on Friday July 20th on all electricity issues other than transmission. While Mr. Barton has publicly held out hope of marking up an electricity bill this month sources on and off the committee do not see this timetable as realistic. On the Senate side the majority staff is working on an electricity white paper that may be circulated for comment next week. Below is a recap of action on amendments of interest to Enron: 1. Last night on a largely partisan vote (with Democrats Hall Green and John voting with the Republicans) the Committee rejected an amendment by Rep. Jane Harman (D-CA) (that was to have been offered by Rep. Anna Eshoo (D-CA)) that would have retroactively amended the FERC refund date and essentially ordered refunds regardless of amounts owed to power sellers. 2. First thing this morning the Committee again on a largely partisan basis (with Democrats Hall Green John and Towns) rejected a Waxman amendment to impose cost-of-service rates on all power in the West (other than generation added after 1/1/01). (Originally Mr. Waxman was going to offer amendment to impose cost-of-service rates only on those who do not supply all available power during an emergency but he ended up offering basically what he had pursued in subcommittee on the old Californa Only bill.) 3. The Committee adopted an amendment by Rep. Shadegg to amend the Natural Gas Act to make it clear that a natural gas transportation facility shall not be added to the National Register of Historic Places until FERC has abandoned the facility. Apparently there have been some instances of old pipelines being considered as historic places under federal law. The House Resources Committee added a similar amendment to its package yesterday. 4. By voice vote the Committee rejected a Waxman Amendment to require the president to propose and implement a plan to bring U.S. greenhouse gases down to 1990 levels. There was strong opposition voiced by many Republicans and Democrats to this amendment. 5. By mixed vote of 24 to 29 the Committee defeated a Waxman Amendment to set cost and performance goals for renewables including wind power and authorize federal funds to assist with commercial project costs (up to 50 percent).,"Energy; House Energy Committee; Legislation; FERC; Natural Gas Act; Greenhouse Gases; Renewables

Just about everyone has an opinion about how to solve California's energy problems. From building more power plants to capping prices to doing away with deregulation federal regulators consumer advocates economists and energy companies all have weighed in with plans for ending the electricity shortages and financial distress that have troubled the state over the past year. Here is a look at what some say California should do now: LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD For many the solution to California's energy woes is to increase the supply of power in the state by building more power plants. A greater supply from more sources would bring wholesale prices down. And two California economists Severin Borenstein at the University of California's Energy Institute in Berkeley and Peter Navarro at the University of California at Irvine argue that the impact would be particularly pronounced in areas where electricity generators now have monopoly or near-monopoly power. We need to build more power plants in close proximity to the ones where companies have market power says Mr. Borenstein. The problem the economists say is that some areas of the state have only one power plant so the energy suppliers can manipulate the price by reducing output at a certain plant when demand is high in order to boost prices. California does get some power from generators in the Northwest and Canada. But because demand is so great in the state and throughout the entire region and supply is limited what is brought in doesn't make much of a dent. The economists add that because suppliers including Williams Co. Duke Energy Mirant Corp. and Enron Corp. have this freedom to charge whatever the market will bear they can take unfair advantage of consumers. For instance in Carlsbad a community in San Diego only one power plant owned by Duke Energy provides electricity to utilities in that area. The company has no competition so it has the ability to set the price for its power according to state Sen. Joseph Dunn a Democrat from Santa Ana who has set up a Senate committee to investigate manipulation in the wholesale power market. If you need electricity and there's only one place to buy it and everyone wants it you're going to pay through the nose says Frank Wolak an economics professor at Stanford University and the director of a power-market monitoring committee which monitors the wholesale electricity market to identify anticompetitive behavior. Is this fair? No. Something must be done about it. Duke Energy spokesman Tom Williams says the company denies that it has ever done this and rejects allegations that it has manipulated the price of electricity. Spokespeople for the other companies also deny such allegations saying prices have surged because demand has outstripped supply. Partly to prevent possible abuse of market power by suppliers the Independent System Operator which runs California's grid contracted with energy companies to have them operate some power plants as reliability must-run units. In return for a fixed annual payment from the state the companies agreed to make these plants available at a moment's notice to balance supply and demand. Electricity from the plants was priced based on the price of natural gas and other variable operating costs. In 1999 the ISO canceled two-thirds of the RMR contracts because the units were rarely called upon due to a steady supply of power in the state and the expense of the contracts to the state. When power prices surged in 2000 however the ISO didn't use the remaining contracts to help keep supply in balance and power costs down. An ISO spokesman says the agency doesn't have a reason to explain why the RMR contracts weren't utilized. He declined to comment further. CAP PRICES While many including Gov. Davis see more power plants as a long-term solution to the state's energy woes they advocate capping the prices of energy sold on the spot market as an interim solution to keep the market stable while the plants are being constructed. In the short term we need price caps Gov. Davis has said to state legislators. That means that [power generators] get all their costs back and a 40% or 50% profit which in this economy is pretty darn good. Robert Glynn chief executive officer of PG&E Corp. unit Pacific Gas & Electric which sold some of its generating plants during deregulation adds that price caps will keep wholesale prices low while new power plants are built. For more than a year the governor had urged the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to place a temporary cap on electricity sold in the spot market saying the move would save the state's consumers billions of dollars on their energy bills while new power plants are being built. In May after many months of rejecting the idea the agency imposed an initial cap on prices in California during emergencies. In June it extended the cap to other Western states and established that it would remain in effect at all times. Wholesale electricity prices at first fell in response to the caps but surged again during a spate of hot weather in early July. FERC has been forced to make a number of adjustments to the cap as a result. These price caps however will expire in September 2002. Gov. Davis believes the caps need to stay in effect longer -- for three years -- to allow for the construction of new plants. RESTORE CREDIT-WORTHINESS Rebuilding a financial base for utilities is key to putting California's power market back on track. One way to do this some experts say is to let the utilities sell bonds to help them pay off debts and recoup the billions of dollars they've lost buying power at prices they couldn't afford. This would then allow the utilities to get investment-grade ratings. All California has to do is to ensure the utilities are credit-worthy again via the bond sale says John Bryson president and chief executive officer of Edison International the Rosemead Calif. parent of Southern California Edison Co. So far the California Assembly and Senate have proposed that Southern California Edison sell $2.9 billion in revenue bonds backed by a surcharge tacked onto the bills of the state's largest businesses to pay off its commercial paper holders and alternative-power producers such as wind and solar generators. The utility has a contract with the alternative-power producers and the price it pays for power is fixed. But the utility has defaulted on those payments. The state believes that Edison International needs to help rescue its struggling utility. A $400 million tax rebate that Edison International is expected to receive from the federal government also could be applied to help the utility out of its financial crisis. The state needs to provide some stability to Edison so we can get back in the power business again says Mr. Bryson. It's a pretty straightforward solution. While utilities still continue to deliver electricity to consumers the state has had to step in to buy the power on their behalf. Energy companies are currently refusing to sell power to the utilities fearing they won't get paid because the utilities have defaulted on prior payments and have no credit. California's 1996 deregulation law uncapped wholesale power prices but froze the rate the utilities could charge consumers. When wholesale prices surged in both the spot and day-ahead markets running well above what the utilities could charge customers the utilities couldn't do anything about it because the state deregulation law didn't allow them to sign long-term supply contracts. Restoring the utilities' credit-worthiness however may not be as quick as Mr. Bryson makes it sound given the huge sums that Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric owe the energy companies that sold them electricity. Pacific Gas & Electric filed for bankruptcy-court protection in April and is trying to write a reorganization plan in just six months pay off all of its creditors in full and return to the power business says the company's Mr. Glynn. CONSERVE ENERGY A massive conservation effort that busts the energy cartel by reducing demand and thus lowering the price of wholesale power is the only way to save the state in the short term says Harvey Rosenfield who heads the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights a consumer-advocacy group in Santa Monica Calif. Only if demand falls so greatly that members of the energy cartel are forced to break ranks and lower prices will conservation solve the short-term problem. Gov. Davis says Californians already are conserving at a record rate. For example in July Californians boosted conservation efforts during the day by 11% compared with the same time last year. Conservation efforts have been suggested from the use of halogen light bulbs to running washing machines in the evening to setting the thermostat at 78 degrees. REREGULATE Nettie Hoge executive director of the Utility Reform Network a consumer-advocacy group based in San Francisco believes the state should return to the days when utilities monopolized the power market. Back then she says power supplies were abundant and prices preset. It was working just fine back then Ms. Hoge says. It's not until we opened this state up to so-called competition that everything started to go in the toilet. Look at us now: We're like a Third World country. We can barely keep the lights on. She says regulation would let consumers know what the price of electricity is and that price would stay the same regardless of fluctuations in supply and demand. California wouldn't be held hostage by out-of-state energy companies that not only control the price of electricity but also control the supply Ms. Hoge says. But some experts say that under federal law it might be impossible for states to reclaim authority over power plants that fall under the jurisdiction of the federal government. And it would cost billions of dollars to construct new government-owned generators or buy back with public funds old utility plants. LEAVE MARKETS ALONE Others believe that California's electricity markets should be left alone to evolve and become more competitive. The state should resist putting in constraints like price caps a number of Wall Street firms have advised the state. Merrill Lynch & Co. Credit Suisse First Boston and Goldman Sachs & Co. are among companies that helped the state and its utilities try to come up with financial solutions earlier this year to help ease the energy problem. None of the plans were implemented however. The state needs to get out of power business says Richard Cortwright an energy analyst at Standard & Poor's Corp. The goal of any new plan should be to eliminate what's left of regulation says Susan Abbott an executive director at Moody's Investor Service Inc. State regulators restricted the utilities from signing forward contracts [locking in power supply at a fixed price] they capped retail rates and never encouraged retail choice says Ms. Abbott. That's the antithesis of a competitive market. Until the state understands competition this energy crisis will just continue to fester for years to come. --- Mr. Leopold is chief of the Los Angeles bureau for Dow Jones Newswires. Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company Inc. All Rights Reserved. Energy (A Special Report) What Now? --- Looking to Washington: What can the feds do to make deregulation a less bumpy process? By Vasugi V. Ganeshananthan 09/17/2001 The Wall Street Journal R13 (Copyright (c) 2001 Dow Jones & Company Inc.) WASHINGTON -- Before California's energy problems began support was building for congressional action on national electricity deregulation. But this year says Sen. Frank H. Murkowski a longtime proponent support for deregulation is not there in my opinion. Still even without a comprehensive package the federal government could take some crucial partial steps toward more-open power markets. Some in Congress have backed measures that would lead to restructuring as opposed to deregulation. That could involve such steps as settling more authority on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to ensure reliability and access to the transmission grid. Another target for Congress will be the remaining antiquated laws and regulations designed for the days of monopolies when each utility had its own borders. The aim is to fix troubled wholesale markets to set the stage for states to elect to deregulate at the retail level. I think it would be in the industry's best interest for this Congress to deal with some of the issues that have been hanging out there for some time says Rick Shapiro managing director of local and governmental affairs at Enron Corp. the Houston-based energy giant. In Congress so far this year several bills have been introduced. The energy bill the House passed in early August offered some modest measures to foster competition such as tax breaks to utilities joining regional transmission organizations or RTOs which FERC has asked energy companies to create to operate the power grid. Rep. Joe Barton a Texas Republican and chairman of the House Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee plans to introduce even more restructuring legislation this fall. His bill may address reliability transmission and incentives for building power plants among other issues. And Sen. Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee has plans for a bill of his own: His main point is to enhance FERC's authority to address power-market problems like reliability and fair access to the grid. But among other issues he is making the latest of several pushes over the past few years to repeal the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 which was designed to prevent large national companies from dominating the industry. Though Congress in 1992 passed the Energy Policy Act permitting competition among wholesale electricity suppliers the 1935 law still limits certain investments by utility holding companies. And many say it impedes competition. Sen. Bingaman also wants to repeal the parts of 1978's Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act that mandate the use of renewable energy though he has said he still supports promoting renewable energy. Of course there are longstanding thorny issues that make federal action on energy markets a tough sell. While some Democrats like Mr. Bingaman are interested in the topic the party in general is less in favor of deregulation than are Republican lawmakers. Thus the recent Democratic takeover of the Senate is widely considered a setback. And while some regions strongly favor change others don't. For instance many Western states -- including Washington whose Democratic Sen. Maria Cantwell is a member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee -- are feeling the ill effects of deregulation in California and are thus leery. Naysayers point to what they say was FERC inaction regarding inadequate power supplies and controversial pricing auctions. From California's perspective FERC failed miserably by doing nothing for month after month after month says Rep. Henry Waxman a Democrat from California. I fear we might make the same mistake at the national level that California made at the state level. But deregulation advocates think nationwide deregulation is inevitable. Would you like to be in an airport where there is one airline from here to Atlanta? Or an airport where there are three airlines including a low-cost option? says Marc Yacker director of government and public affairs for the Electricity Consumers Resource Council a Washington D.C. group of large industrial electricity users. If regulated states see that residents in Pennsylvania and Texas have a well-functioning electricity system . . . they will change. Here are some of the main issues currently being hashed out in Washington: -- WHOLESALE MARKETS: Before any serious discussion of consumer deregulation can take place Mr. Bingaman thinks wholesale markets need to be fixed. Among his main points: clarification of FERC and state jurisdiction. A recent white paper from him outlining his planned legislation calls for Congress to clarify that FERC is the ultimate authority over all transmission issues with the power to overrule states. The paper adds Legislation should affirm FERC's authority to order utilities to join regional transmission organizations. Such powers the thinking goes would allow FERC to ensure that power transmission is fair and that access is free of any favoritism among affiliated utilities. And that would go a long way toward fixing wholesale markets and paving the way for retail deregulation should individual states choose to participate. To leave electricity legislation for another day would be to ensure that the problems faced now in the West will be replicated across the country he wrote in the paper. -- FEDERAL AUTHORITY: The extent to which a federal entity should have authority over power markets is a contentious issue. Mr. Bingaman desires far-reaching powers for FERC. And power suppliers favor having federal regulators hold sway over transmission issues. Eugene Peters of the Electric Power Supply Association a Washington D.C. trade group for competitive power producers says FERC has a role here in that they can essentially create a national template. Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California has also said she will push to get more authority for FERC in order to ensure that all power prices are reasonable -- for instance by assessing civil penalties to power suppliers who engage in unfair pricing. But some in the energy industry say FERC already has plenty of authority -- it's just that the commissioners haven't exercised it properly. Opponents of extending FERC's role fear a tangle of federal bureaucracy reaching a local level. I think that if FERC exercises the authority that I believe that they have in many of these areas legislation is not necessary says Dave Penn executive vice president of American Public Power Association a trade group of public utilities based in Washington D.C. FERC itself isn't arguing strenuously for more authority. Chairman Pat Wood says additional affirmations of authority would probably save the agency time in court later. And he says he wouldn't mind having the ability to assess penalties on utilities that fail to provide reliable service. But he adds While I welcome any authority they want to give us what we've got in the statute now is plenty good enough. -- TRANSMISSION: Transmission is an industrywide beef it's widely acknowledged that with electricity now being sold over greater distances the current system is overtaxed risking bottlenecks and reliability problems. So the nation needs more lines. But who decides where to put them? Plus with the same people selling power and running transmission lines there's a natural inclination for those controlling the transmission lines to want to sell their own electricity first. FERC has ordered the industry to institute RTOs to run the transmission system to ensure fair access to transmission lines no matter who owns them. Sen. Bingaman's proposals would affirm that power for FERC. And Mr. Wood says the RTOs can also handle siting of new transmission lines. But many states are unhappy with FERC's strategies. Some fearing federal interference with the states' authority over siting are taking steps to form their own multistate councils that would ensure regional cooperation while leaving control in state hands. And Maryland the District of Columbia and Virginia are requesting a rehearing of a FERC order that they join RTOs saying that federal regulators are moving with undue haste even in areas where transmission isn't a problem. -- INTERCONNECTION: In a competitive system the growing number of new electricity generators must be able to connect to the power grid. But the interconnection of new generators with the old utilities that own the grid's transmission lines can raise two kinds of problems. On the technical side newer generators can have different types of systems with different generating capacities raising concerns of overloads and other problems. On the competitive side utilities can make it difficult for new generators to connect to the grid. So many in the industry are calling for uniform technical standards to allow equal access to the grid -- once a generator meets the standards a utility would have no basis to deny a hookup -- and to ensure that interconnection doesn't risk the safety and reliability of the system. As we've moved into deregulation there are more entities that want to connect to the system says Ken Rose a senior economist at the National Regulatory Research Institute at Ohio State University. There must be some means he says to ensure that access for all these new players remains fair. FERC's Mr. Wood says interconnection is a top priority for the agency. He has officially asked utilities to file their interconnection rules and FERC will issue a policy on interconnection this fall. Chris Mele legislative director of the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners in Washington D.C. says that interconnection rules need to be flexible. NARUC supports Congress requiring the establishment of national interconnection and power-quality standards that would be developed and adapted by an appropriate technical-standards organization says Mr. Mele. However the states need to have the flexibility to adapt these rules or to adapt their own rules. --- Ms. Ganeshananthan is a staff reporter in The Wall Street Journal's Washington bureau.

Energy (A Special Report) What Happened? --- Lessons From Across the Seas: Deregulation is working pretty well in Britain But it has taken a long time By Geoffrey T. Smith 09/17/2001 The Wall Street Journal R9 (Copyright (c) 2001 Dow Jones & Company Inc.) LONDON -- For all those who just can't understand why electricity deregulation is worth bothering with: Look abroad. It has to be admitted that Europe's deregulation experience looks better than the U.S.'s largely because of the relative starting positions. Europe is the 300-pound couch potato who feels more of a difference after a month in the gym than the guy who is already quite fit. For decades the European electricity industry was run by engineers patronized by politicians. The result: a hugely overbuilt system with rows of underused power plants and legions of unnecessary staff paid for by sky-high regulated rates. Deregulation is starting to put an end to all that. Electricity prices have fallen in most European markets especially in Germany since a European Union deregulation directive took effect in 1999. And in the United Kingdom deregulation has gone further than in most of Europe. Electricity prices are down by around a third for families and businesses and there are few problems with supply. But there is a catch -- an important one for an American public already weary of the pain of deregulation: In Britain it has taken more than a decade to make deregulation start to work. Britain started out with a few advantages that places such as California don't have. Its policy is in the hands of a single central government committed to deregulation while U.S. state and federal regulators often disagree on what needs to be done. It started out owning the whole energy business and could carve it up as it pleased. As it deregulated it didn't have to face the problem of exploding demand due to Silicon Valley and rapid population growth. And Britain unlike California started from a position of significant oversupply and for years was liberal in allowing still more plants to be built because they would be fueled by cheaper and cleaner North Sea natural gas instead of coal. Despite all this British electricity deregulation has had its share of false starts. For 10 years up until 1998 the whole process seemed to be bringing little in the way of concrete gains. For much of the decade the government was a timid pioneer relying on the blunt policy instrument of price controls to bring prices down when its fancy new market models didn't work. But Britain was also willing to try different approaches if its first choice failed -- perhaps a lesson for the U.S. Like California Britain set up a wholesale pool for day-to-day power purchases Britain scrapped the pool when it failed to bring prices down. Britain also allowed power buyers and sellers the crucial freedom to lock in their prices for months ahead insulating them from the price zigzags that have crippled California's two largest investor-owned utilities and sent the biggest PG&E Corp.'s Pacific Gas & Electric Co. unit into Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings. The U.K. has got the balance about right but competition has been a long time in coming says Richard Lewis U.K. managing director of Enron Corp. Houston. The seeds were sown in 1988 when then-Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher decided to extend her free-market ideology to the electricity sector. The British government had a clear idea what it wanted to do. New laws were passed. Deregulation began. By contrast Germany's federal government which started the process at the end of 1998 has had to negotiate electricity deregulation with two other tiers of government and more than 800 electricity companies. Britain split the electricity sector into three parts: power generators completely separate regional suppliers and National Grid PLC to which it gave ownership and control of the country's high-voltage power lines. By separating the grid from the companies that actually sell and produce electricity this structure ensured that no seller could keep others out of the market. The government sold majority stakes in all 12 English and Welsh regional electricity suppliers to the public in December 1990. Six months later it had sold 60% each of National Power PLC and Powergen PLC giving to those two companies almost all the coal-fired power plants in England and Wales. The sale of nuclear generator British Energy PLC followed in 1996. Managers across the sector started cutting cut costs agressively especially for labor. With privatization the design of new plants was increasingly influenced by economic factors such as natural gas's cost advantage over coal rather than political ones. Back in 1988 Britain's old Central Electricity Generating Board had wanted to build expensive new coal plants and nuclear reactors despite the presence of vast untapped natural-gas reserves right on the U.K.'s doorstep in the North Sea. But thanks to privatization almost all the new power plants built in the next 10 years were gas-fired. In fact so many were built that the government slapped a moratorium on new plants in order to cushion if not stop the decline of the domestic coal industry. The moratorium was lifted last November. In the early 1990s a model evolved in which the companies that distributed power to homes and businesses -- known as regional suppliers -- were allowed to charge a specified amount for getting the power to the customer if a company could find a way to do it for less it got to pocket most of the difference. Customers got lower bills and the companies' shareholders were happy -- a little too happy in fact as the public started to resent the fat cat bosses who were seen as skimming off fat profits for little improvement in service. Deregulation really got going in 1994 when the government allowed industry to shop around for its power. A year later it gave up its rights to veto foreign takeovers of suppliers starting a wave of U.S.-led takeovers. But within a few years most of the U.S. firms had either sold or said they intended to although Dallas's TXU Corp. stayed and thrived. For much of the 1990s it wasn't market forces that brought British electricity prices down. Almost all of the cuts in prices to consumers came from [our] price controls on monopolies says Steve Smith head of trading arrangements at the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets the regulator that has implemented government policy under one name or another since 1990. Most of a household's bill comes from the cost of running the distribution network not from producing the power. It was this distribution part of the business that bore the brunt of the price controls. The failure to bring down the price of power itself threatened to provoke a crisis in 1998 when the government finally extended competition to the household and small-business sectors. Nine years after the Electricity Act got the ball rolling the market for customers was 100% open. But something still had to be done about the power generators' prices which weren't falling as expected. In theory British power generators had had to bid into a wholesale pool each day since 1990 telling the National Grid at what price each plant could supply power. The Grid would then buy as much power as needed from each plant starting with the cheapest. But the pool didn't work. There were too few players in it. The generators' prices to resellers -- the regional suppliers -- stayed stubbornly flat. Accusations of market manipulation abounded but could rarely be made to stick. The answer was NETA -- the New Electricity Trading Arrangements which were the centerpiece of last year's Utilities Act. Under the new rules which took effect March 27 electricity has become as close as it is ever likely to be to being a market like any other. Producers consumers and intermediaries now all trade electricity directly with each other up to 3 1/2 hours before they have to deliver or use it -- rather than buying power through an intermediary pool that buys from the generators. The grid operator still manages the physical flow of electricity but intrudes only inasmuch as buyers and sellers have to notify it how much they intend to put into or take out of the grid at each half-hour of the day. NETA has galvanized competition. Prices for electricity have fallen 15% since March according to British regulator Ofgem and they continue to fall. But it's not a question of forcing prices down -- more of allowing the market to set the price of power. More than 7.8 million customers have switched suppliers since 1998. And the Electricity Association a trade group for companies in the electricity business reckons that households can cut almost GBP 30 ($43) or about 12% off their annual bills by switching. At last deregulation is working. NETA has definitely been the right framework to foster competition says Brian Count the new chief executive of Innogy PLC a power generator and supplier that is one of two companies created last year by the breakup of the generation company National Power. But even as the free-marketers lean back and congratulate themselves on a job well done storm clouds gather on the horizon. The Labour government re-elected in June has ordered the U.K.'s first national energy policy review in 20 years. The government is signaling that it wants more control over future investment decisions. The nuclear industry and renewable sources such as wind power look likely to benefit as the British government tries to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions. As Britain's own natural-gas reserves run out in the middle of this decade it will become like the rest of Europe -- uneasily dependent on countries such as Algeria and Russia for supplies. Hence the support for nuclear power. The industry accepts all this but Innogy's Mr. Count speaks for many when he says: For goodness' sake don't let us now get dragged back to central planning and regulation. --- Mr. Smith is an assistant news editor for Dow Jones Newswires in London.

Energy (A Special Report) What Now? --- On Second Thought: In the wake of California's power problems many states are taking a wait-and-see approach to deregulation By Eileen O'Grady 09/17/2001 The Wall Street Journal R13 (Copyright (c) 2001 Dow Jones & Company Inc.) California's energy crisis has a lot of people wondering whether it's really such a good idea to let consumers shop for electricity. No one wants to repeat California's mistakes. So while 12 states and the District of Columbia already offer residential and commercial energy consumers a choice of providers and a handful are pressing ahead with plans to fully deregulate next year some 20 others are either delaying deregulation plans or taking a hard look at whether they ought to move toward competition. And no state has started a new deregulation effort since California's blackouts and price spikes were first reported. But while the fervor for deregulation definitely has cooled not all of the blame can be laid at California's doorstep. Indeed in virtually all of the states that deregulated before California's troubles began -- particularly in Pennsylvania Massachusetts and New Jersey -- consumers have seen for themselves that many of the new entries in the power market haven't delivered on one of the new system's key promises: lower prices. Texas Michigan and Virginia are expected to stick to their plans to open their electricity markets fully next year. But industry sources agree that a lot more states would be about to do the same if California's electricity troubles hadn't given them second thoughts. The advance of retail competition has definitely stalled says Ken Rose a senior economist at the National Regulatory Research Institute at Ohio State University in Columbus a research arm of a national trade group for state utility regulators. The question is whether it reverses Mr. Rose adds. You would expect bumps in the road maybe a slow start but for the past year and a half it's not been going in the right direction. While no state has repealed an electricity-deregulation law in the wake of California's troubles seven states have altered their deregulation laws mostly to delay the start of consumer choice by a few months or a few years -- until state regulators and legislators can see how deregulation plays out elsewhere. Oklahoma one of those states pushed its shopping start date back to 2004 or later from July 1 2002 worried that deregulation might jeopardize its below-average electric rates. California has slowed down the restructuring effort but hasn't stopped it says Oklahoma state Sen. Kevin Easley a Democrat and an early supporter of deregulation. Long term we think it's still a positive thing for Oklahoma. As a major producer of natural gas Oklahoma has attracted a large number of new power plants that run on natural gas. Deregulation its local supporters say thus could help the state create new jobs by encouraging more local power plants that export electricity adding value to the state's natural resources. Nevada where electricity demand is growing dramatically used an emergency measure in April to delay the start of consumer choice for a third time. The measure also froze electricity rates until early next year and placed a moratorium on utility sales of power-generating plants. That effectively undid a customer-choice law passed in 1997 although the state will allow some large customers to shop for power next year. Wisconsin has no deregulation law but its utilities were beginning to propose ways to divide their power-generation assets in order to create a competitive market. When California's problems emerged however Wisconsin Public Service Corp. a unit of WPS Resources Corp. Green Bay withdrew a proposal that would have urged state regulators to allow the company to transfer some of its power plants to a separate company -- a first step toward deregulation. Wisconsin has been set back by California says Larry Weyers chairman of Wisconsin Public Service. Any talk of deregulation is met with a lot of opposition and anything seen as changing the system is dead on arrival. Our plan could have been successful but attitudes became cautious. So much for the states that got cold feet. How are the pioneers faring? Not very well. Most electricity customers in fully deregulated states have seen few competitive options. Figures from regulators indicate that after an initial burst of consumer interest new energy providers in New Jersey New York Massachusetts and Pennsylvania have seen significant reductions in numbers of customers. When New Jersey started letting consumers shop in 1999 about 2.2% of residential consumers switched to a new provider. Now only 1.1% are still buying electricity from a company other than their incumbent utility. Even Pennsylvania which was seen as the biggest deregulation success is beginning to look more ordinary says Mr. Rose the regulatory economist. Some electricity retailers that pulled out of the state blamed a climate of fear arising from California's troubles. But rising wholesale power prices have taken their toll as well says state consumer advocate Irwin Popowsky. In 1998 Pennsylvania residential customers had a choice of at least 30 alternative power providers. Today there are fewer than 10. The reason: The new entries proved unable to compete with the lower capped rates offered by the incumbent utilities industry sources say. Initially Pennsylvania's biggest utility Peco Energy Co. a unit of Chicago-based Exelon Corp. lost 44% of its industrial customers and 30% of its commercial clients to new suppliers according to data published by the state consumer advocate's office in July 2000. One year later however many of those customers had returned to Peco leaving the utility with a loss of only 4.7% of its industrial customers and 5% of its commercial clients. For residential power customers the story's the same: Around the state initially about 10% selected a new supplier before California's problems erupted. Today six of the state's seven original power companies have regained residential customers as competing suppliers leave the market and savings offered by those remaining shrink Mr. Popowsky says. The number of residential customers being served by new suppliers dropped to 574661 as of late June 2001 down 18% from March. It's a price issue says Sharon Reishus associate director at Cambridge Energy Research Associates Cambridge Mass. Though wholesale power prices have fallen since the first part of the year they remain unpredictable she says. A competing provider might be able to make profits say 10 months of the year but could still get killed in the spot market if prices spike Ms. Reishus says. One of the biggest new competitors in Pennsylvania is New Power Co. a subsidiary of NewPower Holdings Inc. Purchase N.Y. New Power bid for and won 250000 Peco Energy customers around the time of Peco's 1999 merger with Unicom Corp. to become Exelon. But New Power's plans extend well beyond the borders of Pennsylvania. It has plans to sell natural gas and electricity to residential consumers and businesses around the U.S. We have seen some volatility in the Pennsylvania market due to the rise in wholesale prices says H. Eugene Lockhart president and chief executive officer of New Power. But he adds we remain committed to serving our customers there and hope to step up our marketing efforts in the near future. But Houston-based Shell Energy Services a unit of Royal Dutch/Shell Group's Shell Oil Co. cited the slowing pace of retail access around the country for its recent decision to drop out of the hunt for new electric customers in Texas and Ohio -- even before markets in those states are fully open. Shell Energy Services had already signed up 40000 residential customers in Texas and 30000 in Ohio but officials said that given the slow progress of deregulation it was unlikely the company would reach the size needed to be profitable in a reasonable length of time. The prospects for selling power to residential customers remain difficult but the opportunity for marketing to business is brighter. Small businesses are seen as key for electricity suppliers seeking new customers says Scott Gahn managing director of commodity management at Enron Corp.'s Enron Energy Services unit which markets power to business. Each month that goes by we're adding gas and power customers in Maine Massachusetts New York New Jersey Illinois Ohio and Texas Mr. Gahn says. He even goes so far as to say that California's impact on deregulation hasn't been all bad. For energy markets in many states he says the California crisis has gotten the issue [of being able to choose your own provider] onto their radar screen in a way that you'd have to pay an advertising agency to do. State officials in Texas Michigan and Virginia where consumers will start shopping next year vow not to repeat California's mistakes. Everyone asks me will we have California's problems? says Tom Noel chief executive of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas which runs the state's power grid. No we won't have their problems but we will have some of our own. The Texas electricity market is very different from that of California. Texas has a copious supply of electricity thanks to extensive construction of power plants powered by natural gas which also is in plentiful supply locally. One reason California got into trouble: Its utilities had to import a lot of electricity and high-priced natural gas to meet the state's growing demand for power. Texas has attracted about two dozen companies to compete for consumers' business through a 1999 deregulation law that carved existing utilities into separate generating transmission and retail units. It has been running a customer-choice pilot program ahead of its Jan. 1 2002 debut of full deregulation. We're in this for the long haul says New Power's Mr. Lockhart. With the opening of the market in Texas there will be a national example of getting it right -- saving consumers money and giving them choices to help manage their energy use. --- Ms. O'Grady is a reporter for Dow Jones Newswires in Houston.

Business/Financial Desk Section C German Deal for U.S. Water Utility By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN 09/17/2001 The New York Times Page 6 Column 3 c. 2001 New York Times Company In the first deal in the United States since the terrorist attacks of last week American Water Works of Voorhees N.J. has agreed to be sold to RWE a German utility for more than $5 billion executives close to the transaction said yesterday. The deal which is expected to be announced today before the markets open will be a crucial test of investor confidence in mergers and acquisitions in the wake of the calamity. One executive said the transaction was being announced now partly as an effort to demonstrate the resolve of businesses worldwide. ''We discussed holding off for obvious reasons'' the executive said. ''But we decided that we should press ahead. The markets need to know that business will continue as usual. And by that I mean business -- the commerce of life -- will not stop in the face of terrorism.'' For RWE the deal represents its latest effort to expand through acquisitions. Last year RWE acquired Thames Water of Britain and the E'town Corporation of New Jersey. American Water Works the largest publicly traded water utility in the nation with annual revenue of $1.4 billion has been acquisitive itself. It recently announced an agreement to buy the Azurix North America Corporation the water utility of the Enron Corporation and is about to complete a deal to buy the water assets of the Citizens Communications Company of Stamford Conn. Spokesmen for American Water Works and RWE could not be reached for comment last night. Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company Inc. All Rights Reserved. Germany's RWE Agrees to Buy American Water Works for $4.6 Billion Plus Debt 09/17/2001 Dow Jones Business News (Copyright (c) 2001 Dow Jones & Company Inc.) ESSEN Germany -- German utility RWE AG said it has agreed to buy American Water Works Co. the largest publicly traded water utility in the U.S. for $4.6 billion plus $3 billion in debt in attempt to expand internationally. RWE said it would offer $46 per outstanding share of American Water Works a 37% premium to American Water Works' share price in the past 30 days. The offer values American Water Works (AWK) at a total $7.6 billion as RWE will offer $4.6 billion for the shares and assume $3 billion in debt it said. Discussions between RWE and American Water had broken down late last month. When the transaction is complete RWE plans to bundle American Water Works which has a market capitalization of $3.3 billion with its Thames Water operations in the U.K. RWE said. RWE is looking to expand internationally to close the gap with competing global utility firms Vivendi SA and Suez SA both larger in size by market capitalization. Last year RWE bought Thames Water PLC of Britain and also acquired E'town Corp. of New Jersey. American Water Works Voorhees N.J. is an aggressive buyer in its own right. It recently announced the purchase of Azurix North America Corp. the North American water-services division of Houston's Enron Corp. for $141.5 million including $8.3 million of debt and tax savings of $13 million for an enterprise value of $136.8 million. It scrapped a planned acquisition of water utility SJW Corp. San Jose California earlier this year after repeated regulatory delays. And it is expected to complete soon a nearly two-year-old deal to buy the water and waste-water assets of Citizens Communications Co. Stamford Connecticut. RWE said shareholders representing 24% of American Water shares have already entered binding agreements to support the transaction. In addition to providing us with a top position in the U.S. the acquisition of American Water will further establish RWE as a global leader in the position of water services RWE Chief Executive Dietmar Kuhnt said in a statement. The development of RWE's world-class water business in turn will provide greater balance to our core utility portfolio and allow us to deliver enhanced growth and shareholder value he added. The deal is expected to be completed within 18 months to two years. The transaction will require shareholder and cartel authority approval. RWE's supervisory board and the board of American Water Works have approved the offer. Copyright (c) 2001 Dow Jones & Company Inc. All Rights Reserved Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company Inc.

BOMBAY Sept 17 (Reuters) - U.S. energy firm Enron Corp's Dabhol Power Co said on Monday it has sought urgent funding from its foreign lenders to repay interest on past loans and preserve a $2.9 billion power plant that is lying idle. Dabhol which is 65 percent owned by Houston-based Enron said monthly interest payments to its lenders have to be made in September but it does not have enough cash. It has about 25 foreign lenders which include ABN AMRO Citibank US Exim and Bank of America. The company has funds in its account to make certain payments and anticipates that some of those will be made. It has requested disbursement from banks towards the rest the spokesman told Reuters. He did not disclose details of the interest payments nor the cash it wants. The project has been funded 70 percent by debt. Dabhol has not been earning any income after its sole customer the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) in May stopped buying any more power from its plant citing high tariffs. MSEB was buying the entire output from the plant's first phase of 740 MW and had committed to buy the second phase output of 1444 MW when it was ready. Following the cancellation foreign and local lenders stopped disbursals of around $400 million forcing complete stoppage of work on the second phase. They have also declined to provide funds to preserve expensive equipment from being damaged by natural elements. Without funds for preserving the facility the physical assets will begin to deteriorate almost immediately which in turn will further add to the overall cost of completion the spokesman added. Dabhol now wants at least a portion of this $400 million amount disbursed to help it meet its interest payments and take care of the plant. The development is likely to put further pressure on India's federal government to solve the contentious dispute which has affected the country's efforts to attract foreign investment in the power sector. Three foreign power companies have already pulled out including French giant Electricite de France . Analysts believe that a quick solution to the problem is key to restoring investor confidence. UGLY SPAT Once considered the showpiece of India's liberalisation programme the Dabhol project is now being dubbed an example of political and bureaucratic bungling. Enron has announced its decision to sell its equity in the project to the federal government or any other company. It says MSEB is yet to pay bills worth $185 million. On Monday Dabhol further upped the ante by slapping MSEB with two preliminary notices of termination. One is for not paying bills for the months of June and July and the other for MSEB's decision in May to cancel the power purchase agreement the contract that governs the state board's purchase of power from Dabhol. This is the third such notice from Dabhol. In May it served the first notice for non-payment of bills for December and January. The two fresh notices are a body blow for MSEB analysts said as it means the state utility could end up fighting three separate arbitration battles. According to the power purchase agreement all disputes will have to be settled by the International Court of Arbitration in London. As per this agreement serving preliminary notice is followed by a six-month cooling off period. If the dispute is not settled by then Dabhol can issue a final notice and the dispute automatically goes for arbitration. The six-month period for the first notice which was issued in May ends in November. If there is no settlement by then MSEB will have to answer Dabhol's charges of non-payment of bills for December and January. The same procedure will be followed in the case of the other two notices. But efforts to solve the issue so far through arbitration have been delayed by domestic litigation. MSEB wants the dispute to be heard by local courts while Dabhol is pressing for arbitration in London. The Bombay high court which began hearing this dispute on Monday is expected to give a final verdict soon. ($1=48.83 Indian rupees). Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company Inc. All Rights Reserved. UK: INTERVIEW-Screen trading enhances metals market. By Martin Hayes 09/17/2001 Reuters English News Service (C) Reuters Limited 2001. LONDON Sept 17 (Reuters) - The emergence of electronic screen systems alongside existing open-outcry and telephone markets has enhanced trading in base metals Paul Shuman LME desk manager at Cargill Investor Services (CIS) said. From our perspective because we are brokers and do not run a proprietary position we are bound and always will be to try and get the best price for our customers. The more platforms there are for us to trade on the better for our customers Shuman told Reuters. The London Metal Exchange (LME) the world's leading non-ferrous metals market introduced an automated trading system (ATS) known as Select in February and unveiled a more sophisticated phase last week. The LME's system joined rival platforms managed by Spectron Metals and Enron Online part of Enron Corp. These systems have improved market liquidity and increased price transparency throughout the day Shuman said. Instead of being restricted to the ring and the telephone market where you have to ring around you have instant access to bids and offers all through the day. Now when we give our customers a market we can do that on the basis of the best bid and offer on the screen. From our company's perspective it has been very helpful he said. Spreads between bids and offers have narrowed and access to the market has become faster. It is certainly a tighter market a quicker market and probably a more liquid market he said. SCREENS NOT PARAMOUNT However the LME's ATS is not designed to replace open-outcry on the 124-year-old exchange. Rather it will complement the current mix of inter-office phone trading and open-outcry. Screens do not replace the ability to talk to one another he said. There are instances when customers needs to transact a highly complex multi-legged carry or spread trade and it is unlikely that any system will be able to replicate that. You phone up another broker and say what you want to do. You either have to do it face-to-face or on the phone - you cannot do it on the screen - speed is important. He said there may well be a fall-off in volume at one or other of the current platforms but the screens and the telephone market are likely to run in tandem while the LME plans to continue open-outcry ring trading as well. For the customers they are going to get the best of all worlds he added. LME SCREENS GAINING ACCEPTANCE On the screens the dust has still to settle between the rivals but there are signs that LME Select is being used more by the market. In the last few weeks Select has done better as more people have become used to it and it (Select) is free whereas some others are not Shuman said. And now the Select system is much more capable after the release of the second more sophisticated phase. It is very ambitious and it will be interesting to see how it works he said. The second release incorporates a unique request-for-quote function. This allows traders to direct enquiries such as market size and depth to as many or as few respondents as required and whether or not to be anonymous. It also covers all the LME's contracts - the initial release was confined to the basic cash three months and cash-to-threes spread contracts. It is going to take a while for Select Two to become the tool for the industry. But Cargill is in favour of anything that allows us to give a better service to our customers Shuman said.

PARIS -(Dow Jones)- French electricity bourse Powernext SA took one step closer to its imminent launch with the announcement Monday that it will host a series of simulations from Sept. 25. Powernext will stage three sets of simulations the first from Sept. 25 to Sept. 27 the second on Oct. 2-4 and the third on Oct. 9-11 Powernext said in a press statement. Close to 20 companies will participate in the tests including electricity suppliers traders the exchange's investors industrial consumers and traders. TXU Europe Energy Trading and Enron will be among the participants. The exchange is also holding seminars this week for participants to get acquainted with the ElWeb electronic trading system also currently used by Nord Pool in the Nordic region the market model and Clearnet the exchange's financial guarantor. Jean-Francois Conil-Lacoste Powernext's director-general said the exchange is still on track for its official launch later this autumn although a date hasn't been set yet. Euronext Paris SA and HGRT a financial holding for European electricity grid operators hold 34% and 17% of Powernext respectively. Currently Electricite de France (F.EDF) is the sole shareholder in HGRT although the long-range plan envisions Dutch grid operator TenneT and Belgian counterpart Elia as potential investors. Powernext aims to expand its activities in the Benelux region dovetailing newly created Euronext formed through a merger of the Paris Brussels and Amsterdam stock exchanges. Powernext will also announce later this autumn the addition of new investors. Currently the remaining 49% is divvied up among French banks BNP Paribas (F.BNP) and Societe Generale (F.SGF) plus state-owned EDF oil giant TotalFinaElf (TOT) and Belgian utility Electrabel (B.ELE) which each hold 9.8%. These stakes will fall to 5.0% with the entry of the new investors the threshold necessary to hold one seat on the board of directors. The exchange plans to initially offer physical electricity in hourly blocks for delivery the next day. Separately EDF Trading the London-based trading joint venture of EDF with commodities trader Louis Dreyfus will start trading in the French wholesale market Oct. 1. EDF's Director of Client Services Loic Caperan said last week. EDF Trading is barred by the European Union Competition Authority from trading in the French retail market. The trading arm isn't allowed to assist EDF to structure contracts for France's energy-intensive industrial consumers the group eligible to choose suppliers representing about one-third of domestic power consumption. But the entry of EDF Trading into the wholesale market is viewed by some traders as crucial to injecting necessary liquidity for electricity trading to flourish in France. The pace of power market deregulation is slowly starting to pick up in France. Powernext is the second project to launch this autumn aimed at kick-starting trading. Last week EDF auctioned options on close to 1200 megawatts of local power production. As the E.U.'s second-largest power market which shares its borders with five countries and is connected to the U.K. via an under-water electricity interconnector France is key to the eventual formation of a pan-European traded market. -By Sarah Wachter Dow Jones Newswires 331-4017-1740 sarah.wachter@dowjones.com -0- 17/09/01 09-56G Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company Inc.

RWE to Buy American Water Works for $7.6 Billion (Update6) 2001-09-17 07:02 (New York) RWE to Buy American Water Works for $7.6 Billion (Update6) (Adds where American Water is based in second paragraph moves stock drop to seventh adds context in third paragraph.) Essen Germany Sept. 17 (Bloomberg) -- RWE AG Europe's No. 4 power company agreed to buy American Water Works Inc. the biggest publicly traded U.S. water utility for $7.6 billion in cash and assumed debt in a bid to catch up with larger rivals. RWE is offering $46 in cash per share 35 percent more than last Monday's close for the Vorhees New Jersey-based company. Germany's RWE will assume $3 billion of American Water's debt said Chief Financial Officer Klaus Sturany on a conference call. The purchase will add more than 10 million U.S. customers to RWE's water unit and further reduce its reliance on the German electricity market. It will also help RWE narrow the gap to Suez SA and Vivendi Environnement SA a year after Chief Executive Dietmar Kuhnt spent $9.8 billion on Thames Water Plc of the U.K. ``RWE has said it wants to expand in water and this is another step in that direction'' said Ulf Moritzen who helps manage 100 million euros ($93 million) at Nordinvest. ``In the current situation it makes sense to buy a defensive business.'' The planned purchase isn't cheap. Including debt RWE will pay about 5.4 times sales for the U.S. company compared with 4.9 times sales for Thames Water. In the U.S. buyers paid about 4 times sales for the 15-plus takeovers in the country's water industry over the past two years according to Bloomberg data. Stock Drops Including pending acquisitions by the U.S. company the price will rise to about $8.4 billion by closing said Sturany. RWE will sell an unspecified amount of new bonds to finance the purchase he said without giving a time frame. RWE shares fell as much as 2.27 euros or 5.5 percent to 38.90 euros in Frankfurt. They've declined 17 percent this year. American Water shares closed at $34.12 last Monday the last day U.S. markets were open before the terrorist attacks. The acquisition is the biggest announced since terrorists attacked the World Trade Center and the Pentagon last Tuesday. Sturany said the companies reached an agreement last week though they decided to delay the announcement because of the disaster. ``We have enormous confidence in the U.S. economy'' Sturany said. ``Despite the enormity of the events we expect the U.S. market to prevail.'' He said the contract with American Water doesn't include any special clauses related to the attack. After the purchase which may take as long as two years to complete the Essen Germany-based company will have 56 million water customers worldwide according to spokesman Bill McAndrews. Suez and Vivendi each serve more than 100 million people. More Purchases Sturany said American Water which will become a unit of Thames Water will expand further in the U.S. by using the German company's ``strong balance sheet.'' The Thames Water purchase last year gave RWE New Jersey-based utility E'town Corp. RWE said the new acquisition will make it the largest water company in the U.S. the world's biggest single market. American Water has customers in 23 U.S. states the German company said. The U.S. market with more than 54000 local utilities is ``ripe'' for consolidation he said. RWE today said the latest purchase will help boost earnings before goodwill in the first year after completion. The company had sales of $1.35 billion last year and employs 5000 people throughout the U.S. RWE's total debt will rise to about 8 billion euros ($7.4 billion) after the purchase Sturany said. RWE's debt-to- equity ratio was about 2.8 before the purchase compared with 41 times for Vivendi Environnement according to Bloomberg data. The yield on RWE's outstanding 6.5 percent 20-year bond rose 0.1659 or 0.2 percent to 100.0455 after the announcement. RWE in April sold 3.46 billion euros worth of bonds to help pay for Thames Water including 350 million pounds in 20-year bonds. RWE has an ``Aa3'' rating from Moodys' Investors Service and a ``AA-'' rating from rival agency Standard & Poor's. Merrill Lynch & Co. and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter advised RWE on the U.S. purchase. Goldman Sachs advised American Water. RWE said 24 percent of American Water's shareholders are already backing its takeover offer which has also been approved by the German and the U.S. companies boards of directors. Enron India Unit Serves Second Notice to Cancel Power Contract 2001-09-17 08:50 (New York) Mumbai Sept. 17 (Bloomberg) -- Dabhol Power Co. Enron Corp.'s Indian unit said it has served a second notice on the state-owned Maharashtra State Electricity Board stating that it will start proceedings to cancel its power supply contract because its waiting to be paid past dues. Enron owns 65 percent of Dabhol Power Co. which runs the $3 billion power plant India's biggest foreign investment. It is owed $64 million by the Maharashtra State Electricity Board its sole customer in unpaid bills for 9 months. The board in May stopped buying power saying it's too expensive. ``Little progress has so far been made on reaching a fair and reasonable solution'' to the payments dispute the company said in a statement. Enron on May 19 issued the first notice to cancel the power supply contract with the board. It began looking to sell its stake in the project after the negotiation panel failed to get other buyers for its power. Eight Indian states said they would buy electricity but at less than half the price charged by Dabhol. Enron said it has invested $875 million in the project and is ready to sell to the government its stake at cost.,"Energy; Deregulation; California; United States; Europe; Germany; India; United Kingdom

399,Confidential - Calif Peaking Plant,Phil-- Enron is currently evaluating the possibility of installing an NGL peaking facility with appurtenant storage and rail facilities near Needles California. Ideally the plant would inject / vaporize normal butane at the rate of 18750 gallons per hour into a high pressure natural gas transmission system. Current gas pipeline specs are as follows: Operating pressure - 850 - 1000 psig worst case 750 normal range 800-900 Gas Volume - 650000 - 750000 MMBtu/day Expected normal butane (GPA spec) requirement - 450000 gallons/day (18750 gal/ per hour) My questions are: 1) Is anyone currently using butanes for peaking service and if so where? 2) Do we need to blend with air (how much) or can we inject straight normal butane? 3) At what line pressure point do the butanes re-liquefy further downstream of the injection point as the pipeline pressure falls? 4) Is this peaking plant configuration feasible and if so at what price (ball park here don't go way out of your way)? (If it's not what would your suggestion be for a design). I will fax you the normal butane specs as soon as I get them (please email back your fax number). As always we're on a pretty tight time frame. After you've had a chance to review the above I'd like to get together and discuss this with you. I can meet you in Ohio if it fits your schedule better just let me know. Thanks for the help and I look forward to talking with you soon.

Joe Allen continues as part of the Texas legislative team working for the head of that group (formerly Kathleen Magruder). Terry Thorn has taken a commercial position in Enron and no longer works on government affairs issues for the company (except to the extent we call on various executives to help from time-to-time).

406,EPSA Meeting On RTO Legislation,We had a positive result in the EPSA Legislative Affairs Committee meeting yesterday afternoon. The EPSA staff draft of a letter to Barton on his RTO discussion proposal will be significantly strengthened and EPSA staff will start by incorporating the comments I sent over earlier in the week. The original draft said the Barton RTO language only needed technical corrections. EPSA staff reiterated that some member co. or cos. think Barton's draft could have been worse. My reply was this logic was like saying we should be grateful he shot us in the head instead of hanging us -- one method may be more humane but either way we are dead (OK the analogy may be too rough -- but it made the point.) (I subsequently confirmed that Reliant is the soft member -- their rep. told me they support the discussion draft although they wouldn't object if it is strengthened.) A stronger EPSA letter with more specific reasons why we oppose the Barton discussion draft will be circulated among EPSA members today or Monday with the goal of sending the letter first thing Tuesday when Congress returns. Some wanted a general letter requesting a meeting and deferring specific comments until the meeting. I pointed out that Barton is speaking to subcommittee members right now and that we needed to copy them on a more detailed letter ASAP so they hear from us before Barton gets to them. We will make the same contacts ourselves. In fact we have already started. Spoke to Reps. Chip Pickering and Rep. Greg Walden both subcommittee Republicans this week (did same with staff to Rep. John Shimkus). Key task when House staff return to work on Tuesday will be finding out where Ranking Member Rick Boucher is on the Barton RTO draft.

414,Recap of House Action Last Night on Energy Package,Late last night the House on a 240-189 vote passed as amended H.R. 4 -- the Securing Amerca's Future Energy (SAFE) Act of 2001. Here is what happened on the three amendments of interest to Enron: 1. The House overwhelmingly defeated (154 to 274) a Waxman Amendment (D-CA) to impose cost of service rates on wholesale sales of electricity in the WSCC for 18 months. Only three House Republicans supported the amendment (all from California -- Gallegly Issa and Hunter) 57 Democrats opposed the Waxman Amendment including all of the Texas Democrats EXCEPT Frost Hinojosa Rodriguez and Doggett (these four SUPPORTED the Waxman Amendment). Thus our collective lobbying efforts in recent months focusing on California Republicans Texas Democrats and other moderate Democrats worked out in the end. 2. The House also overwhelmingly defeated the Cox Amendment (R-CA) to grant California a waiver of the Clean Air Act's oxygenate requirement for reformulated gasoline. The vote was 125 to 300 (44 Republicans 80 Democrats and 1 independent voted for the amendment 173 Republicans 126 Democrats and 1 independent) voted against it. 3. The House also defeated the Green Amendment (D-TX) to repeal the Natural Gas Act's Hinshaw Exemption as it applies to California's intrastate natural gas pipelines. The vote was 154 to 275 (123 Republicans and 31 Democrats voted for it while 95 Republicans 178 Democrats and 2 independents voted against the amendment). Please call or e-mail with comments or questions. The Senate Energy Committee is starting its work this week on an energy package with consideration of an R&D title (other issues will be taken up in September including electricity). The House Energy and Commerce Committee will now turn to electricity issues with staff drafting during the August Recess hearings in September and votes on legislation in September or early October.,"Energy; House; Legislation; California; Texas; Democrats; Republicans

418,WSP: Market Ripe for Manipulation...,Cc list suppressed... Public opinion is the pendulum that swings law...dsg August 4 2000 Deregulation Leaves Electricity Market Ripe for Manipulation by Power Firms By REBECCA SMITH and JOHN J. FIALKA Staff Reporters of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL It's a market ripe for manipulation: surging demand for an indispensable commodity weak oversight and a chaotic new set of rules amid a transition from heavy regulation to open competition. This is the state of the U.S. electricity business in the summer of 2000. And sure enough there's growing evidence that some power companies are finding lucrative ways to exploit the system -- at consumers' expense. The tactics include manipulating wholesale electricity auctions taking juice from transmission systems when suppliers aren't supposed to and denying weaker competitors access to transmission lines. None of this is illegal and much of it might be considered basic competition. But as an electricity shortage plunges sweltering California into an energy crisis and fears of even worse shortages rattle the Northeast the practices of power suppliers face more scrutiny than ever. (See related article.) Steamy Conditions A hot summer day last year shows one kind of manipulation. On July 28 1999 wholesale electricity prices in the Middle Atlantic states hit $935 per megawatt hour. That was seven times what it costs to generate power at the most expensive plant in the region. An analysis of trading data from that day shows that PECO Energy Corp. and PPL Corp. the old Philadelphia Electric Co. and Pennsylvania Power & Light made the most of steamy conditions. In the region's power market deregulated in 1997 a new corporation called PJM Interconnection LLC runs the transmission system once operated piecemeal by eight utilities. It also operates a daily electricity auction that sorts the hourly bids of 540 generating plants. The cheapest plants are called on first but when the weather is hot and demand is acute higher offers are taken as well. To attract as many bidders as possible the highest bid each hour sets the price for the entire market for that hour. Grid and Bear It Rise in average wholesale electricity prices at key transmission-interconnection points for the month of May from 1997 to 2000. TRANSMISSION-INTERCONNECTION POINT % CHANGE 1997-2000 Texas +293% +216 Tennessee Valley Authority +165 California-Oregon border +162 New York-West +138 Chicago area +130 New England +117 New York-East +101 Upper Midwest +99 Florida +89 Mid-Atlantic region +80* *Includes only years 1999-2000 Source: Federal Energy Regulatory Commission RDI Power What PECO and PPL did was offer much of their output at low prices so that the majority of their plants would be called into service. But knowing demand was so high they offered power from their tiniest plants at vastly higher bids in a way that often set the peak price for a number of hours. Consumers that day ended up paying millions of extra dollars for power. Cases like this show that during the transition to deregulation there's a good argument the system has broken down says William Massey a commissioner at the Federal Energy Regulatory Agency. FERC which polices the nation's bulk power markets began the deregulation movement in 1996. It wasn't supposed to be this way. In the old days utilities generated electricity and delivered it to customers in exclusive territories. To protect consumers from gouging rates were regulated. But while supply had to be able to meet peak demand at all times demand varied widely within regions between regions and from one season to another. The result was tremendous reliability but also inefficiency and waste. Deregulation now under way in half the country and functioning nationally at the wholesale level allows new players -- some affiliated with utilities some not -- to build power plants and sell electricity. Prices are supposed to be set by competitive markets. Risks are borne by investors not ratepayers. At the same time utilities are surrendering control of long-haul transmission lines to new nonprofit operators like the one in the Middle Atlantic region which are supposed to ensure fair access to the grid -- the multistate system of high voltage lines. Under this new regime energy prices should have dropped as companies raced to compete with one another. But the massive U.S. energy infrastructure wasn't designed to serve as the backbone of a free market. On hot summer days when there's little or no surplus electricity in the nation's most populous regions generators can charge prices far in excess of their production costs and be confident they'll get tapped for service by grid operators who must keep the lights on at any cost. Utility holding companies that still control transmission lines have an added advantage: They can effectively lock out cheaper competitors. California Cuts Price Cap for Electricity Once Again (Aug. 2)Price Cap Is Set for Electricity That Is Sold in New England (July 27)PPL KeySpan Say Earnings Surpassed Wall Street Targets (July 27)Energy Trading Internet Operations Help Enron's Net Income Jump 30% (July 25)PG&E Posts 36% Rise in Net to $248 Million (July 21) The new regional grid operators called independent system operators or ISOs eventually will be in charge of preventing manipulation. But as nongovernmental organizations they won't have basic investigative tools like subpoena powers or the ability to impose significant penalties. FERC which does have those powers rarely uses them preferring to let the market discipline itself. A Strange Drop Sometimes it's difficult to know what constitutes an abuse of the market. In July 1999 engineers noticed that a substantial amount of power was being taken from the grid for which there was no explanation. They contacted the North American Electric Reliability Council the industry group charged by Congress with overseeing the grid since the late 1960s. After a lengthy investigation NERC determined that Cinergy Corp. a utility holding company had surreptitiously taken enough power over a three-day period about 9600 megawatt hours to light a small city for a month. Cincinnati-based Cinergy had underestimated power demands. Rather than buy electricity on the open market at ferociously high prices or cut power to Cincinnati it quietly borrowed power from the system when demand was peaking and later replaced it in the cool of the night when demand wasn't so high. James E. Rogers Cinergy's chief executive received a letter from A.R. Garfield the chairman of NERC's regional power-coordination center accusing his company of showing blatant disregard for the rules and of using the grid as a supplemental resource without regard to the reliability or integrity of the system. But Cinergy paid no fine. That's because it runs its own transmission control area and is trusted to enforce NERC's voluntary rules even when it is the violator. Smaller utilities in Cinergy's area by contrast face contractual penalties of as much as $35000 per megawatt for unilaterally borrowing from the grid a practice known as leaning on the ties. Dancing on the Edge? Mr. Garfield is still steamed about Cinergy's actions which he said removed part of the system's essential reserve needed to avoid cascading blackouts or a chain of uncontrollable outages that could darken whole sectors of the country. How fair is it that someone can dance on the edge like that and get away with it? he asks. Mr. Rogers points to old rules that permit utilities to temporarily borrow small amounts of power during emergencies. We were very careful to make sure when we leaned on the ties ... we didn't bring the whole system down he says. Nevertheless he concedes in a competitive world those rules need to be changed. The region's regulators have since gone to FERC for authority to charge borrowers for the market value of the electricity they take off the grid. Leaning on the ties is only one way fair competition is being frustrated on the country's transmission system a vast web of connections that resembles the nation's highway system before the construction of the interstates. While there are plenty of routes to get electricity from outlying power plants directly to big cities there are relatively few routes connecting regions. That makes it possible for some big companies to shut out competitors. A Snag in Transmission St. Louis-based Aquila Energy hit that snag when it tried to use a transmission corridor owned by New Orleans-based Entergy Corp. to move electricity to a buyer in East Texas. Entergy granted the request initially but then it canceled saying it didn't have sufficient space on its lines. Aquila didn't buy it. After analyzing transmission-capacity data the company argued to FERC that Entergy did have enough space on its lines and so was in effect breaking a rule that required it to provide transmission-line access when possible. Without access to Entergy's lines Aquila was forced to compensate the buyer and lost nearly $300000 on the deal. From whom did the Texas customer end up buying the power? A unit of Entergy -- and for a higher price than it would have paid Aquila. FERC said Entergy had been within its rights to restrict access in this case because it had transmission problems. But FERC found that Entergy on other occasions had hoarded transmission capacity that should have been made available to the market. Entergy declines to comment. Such scenarios are costly for consumers and they are among the reasons the electricity industry is enjoying flush times. In the second quarter just ended companies ranging from AES Corp. in Arlington Va. to Enron Corp. in Houston reported huge profit increases some as much as 50%. To be sure a lot of those profits are coming from extraordinary demand growth and a pickup in energy trading. But Sean Murphy president of Southern Energy New England a unit of Southern Cos. Atlanta Ga. worries that the industry has gotten too greedy and risks retribution. Pigs get fat but hogs get slaughtered he says. Tremendous Volatility New federal data show that average wholesale power prices have more than doubled at 14 of 17 key pricing points across the country in the past three years. By May of this year prices had risen across a broad range -- by 89% in Florida for example and by 294% in Texas. But even these increases mask the tremendous volatility that has struck all the major wholesale markets during the past year. In the case of the Midwest where prices in July 1999 hit $9000 per megawatt hour it was as if a $1.89 gallon of gas suddenly sold for $567. Prices like these have prompted growing calls for investigations into whether electric companies are gouging their customers. Some consumer groups lukewarm to deregulation in the first place now are agitating for re-regulation. Residential electricity bills have doubled in San Diego which is notable because it's the first city in the nation to be served by a utility that's buying all of its energy on the competitive market. Politicians are sounding the alarm in the Pacific Northwest. There wholesale prices peaked at a record $1300 per megawatt hour during the last week in June. Energy-intensive industries like mines and aluminum smelters are cutting back on production and temporarily laying off workers. We may be seeing too much opportunism in the market says Montana Gov. Marc Racicot. Demands by Mr. Racicot and his counterpart in Washington Gary Locke were instrumental in prompting FERC to open a national investigation in late July into possible market abuses. A Six-Month Lag One big premise on which deregulation rests is that a free flow of information will let markets police themselves and operate efficiently. But a key tool for market monitoring the data on utility Web sites used to book transmission orders is often unreliable. There's a six-month lag on the release of bidding data which are coded to mask the identities of bidders. What's more the four FERC-controlled ISOs operating in California the Middle Atlantic states New England and New York don't have the authority to compel market participants to give them internal documents like bilateral contracts and other information they don't want to hand over. Without such documents there's a lot more looking than finding says Bill Museler chief executive of the New York ISO. Even if the ISOs do find something problematic there isn't much they can do about it. The tariffs contracts and bylaws under which they operate generally prohibit them from releasing company-specific data and so exposing wrongdoers. And with the exception of California the ISOs' own board meetings are closed to the public. The reality is confidentiality rules protect the guilty says Frank Wolak a professor of economics at Stanford University and chairman of the California ISO's Market Surveillance Committee. And there are no codes of conduct to instill a sense of fair play. That can be a huge problem on hot days. In California an independent exchange runs a daily forward auction in which it tries to match the next day's anticipated demand to bids by generators. But this summer generators often have offered less power than they know will be needed so that they can submit higher bids later when the ISO is forced to pay stiffer prices for emergency power. On occasion ISO engineers have had just 40 minutes to frantically phone around and nail down suppliers knowing that if they fail they could be forced to begin rolling blackouts. The bidding strategy while legal undermines reliability and forces the ISO to do some real gymnastics says Kellan Fluckiger chief operations officer for the California ISO. Generators say they aren't to blame for the mad scramble. Utilities buying power for their customers often order less power than they really need for fear that a big order will drive up the overall market price to prohibitive levels. The only real recourse available to the ISOs is to rewrite the rules governing their local markets. But FERC is reluctant to let them meddle too often because generators are investing billions of dollars based on existing market rules. There's another reason too says Ron Rattey a veteran FERC economist who in June wrote a 10-page internal memo criticizing the agency for not doing more to ferret out unfair conduct. Every single ISO has identified strategic abuses he says. And every time the ISOs make adjustments to the rules the market participants find new ways around them.

424,Talking Points For Rep. Barton On Tauzin RTO Letter,Linda requested some background and talking points on the pending RTO letter from Chairman Tauzin to FERC that is sitting on Chairman Barton's desk TODAY for his decision whether to co-sign the letter. While we have not seen the text we are told that it is anti-RTO and may go so far as to state or imply that FERC does not have authority to do what is doing with RTOs. (We know this is the view of one of Chairman Tauzin's counsels who formerly worked for Southern Co.). Chairman Tauzin has been contacted by Entergy and the Louisiana Public Service Commission to send the letter. I spoke to Chairman Barton's staff Andy Black this afternoon and relayed our concerns. The Barton Subcommittee is now expected to mark up an electricity bill in December (per a Republican Member meeting held this morning). ACTION ITEM: Call Rep. Joe Barton (202/225-2002) TALKING POINTS: 1. Should start with something about the Dynegy/Enron transaction (it will be strange if Mr. Lay or Steve calls Chairman Barton and does not start the conversation with some reference to the transaction). 2. Mentioning the transaction naturally leads into the importance of competitive wholesale markets for power both for consumers and for the largely Texas-based marketing trading and merchant power industries. 3. We understand that Chairman Barton has been approached by Chairman Tauzin about a letter to FERC on the RTO issue. We know Chairman Barton is well aware of Enron's strong support for FERC's RTO initiatives. We respect Chairman Barton's interest in seeing to it that Congress does not abdicate its responsibility to make energy policy. 4. If as we have been lead to believe the letter states or implies that FERC does not have authority to act in the RTO arena this will be seen as a potentially destabilizing development since FERC is so far down the road of creating RTOs. 5. While we understand some in Congress and elsewhere were concerned that FERC was moving too fast as of the last FERC meeting earlier this month that is no longer true even if it ever was true. While we think RTOs should be created sooner rather than later FERC is listening to state regulators and others who had concerns. 6. A letter from congressional leaders questioning FERC's authority goes too far in the direction of those who oppose any RTOs. Furthermore it is wrong as a matter of law. The D.C. Circuit held in the gas cases and in the power cases on Order 888 that FERC has authority to address systemic discrimination which is in large part what the RTOs are all about -- a remedy for discrimination.,"Energy Policy; FERC; RTOs; Congress

435,"Texas energy exec says, I told you",Jeff FYI ?From the Contra Costa Times (East San Francisco Bay Area) Kevin Published Friday June 22 2001 Texas energy exec says 'I told you' POWER CRISIS ? Enron's Skilling gets pied before his speech blaming lawmakers but says he understands Californians' anger By Rick Jurgens TIMES STAFF WRITER SAN FRANCISCO -- A Texas energy executive who said his warnings were ignored by regulators who restructured California's electricity industry came to the Bay Area on Thursday to say in effect I told you so. Jeffrey Skilling chief executive of Houston-based Enron Corp. said that California wouldn't be in its current mess if regulators had followed his advice in 1994 and 1995. Regulators erred by forcing wholesale electricity transactions into the spot market so that deals could more easily be monitored Skilling said in a speech to about 100 people at the Commonwealth Club of California. They created a flawed marketplace in the name of regulatory expediency. Enron is a broker that buys and sells contracts to deliver power. Such bilateral transactions shouldn't have been banned Skilling said. Skilling said that's what he said six years ago. I probably made a pest of myself (in the restructuring hearings called by regulators) because I told them they were doing it wrong he said. They finally told me to keep quiet. On Thursday night it was Skilling's turn to be pestered. A woman threw a chocolate pie into his face before the event began. Police said Francine Cavanaugh of Oakland was arrested on suspicion of battery and released. Skilling tried to ignore protesters but said he understood why Californians facing blackouts and rising power costs were angry. He even had kind words for Gov. Gray Davis who he said was dealt a very difficult hand. Skilling became Enron's chief executive in February replacing company founder Kenneth Lay an early proponent of electricity deregulation who is close to President Bush. Enron a global energy giant with roots in the natural gas industry owns some power plants but its influence in the electricity industry reflects the rapid growth of its energy trading operation. Enron's only California generators are small wind facilities. However the company has developed power plants. Enron initiated two 750-megawatt projects that were sold to Calpine Corp. including a Pittsburg plant due to go online next month. Enron has announced plans to seek regulators' approval for a 750-megawatt power plant in Roseville in Placer County. During the first three months of 2001 Enron posted a huge jump in revenue to $50.1 billion from $13.1 billion a year ago but a much smaller gain in net income to $425 million from $338 million. Skilling himself cashed an $850000 paycheck and got a $5.6 million bonus last year. But the energy crisis has taken its toll on Enron's stock price and on Skilling who owned or held options to buy 1.9 million shares of Enron common stock at the time of the company's February proxy filing. At Thursday's closing price of $44.05 a share the stock was down more than 50 percent from its 52-week high of $90.75 in August. That proved that Enron wasn't the villain in California Skilling said. This thing in California has been bad for everybody he said. If we had anything to do with this we're the stupidest people in the world.

Davis's Plan To Power California --- State's Outlays for Electricity May Be Hard to Recover Without Rate Increases --- Betting on Long-Term Deals ------------------------ Breakthrough made in rescue of PG&E State ready to pay $7 billion for lines By Steve Geissinger SACRAMENTO BUREAU SACRAMENTO -- Signaling a breakthrough in secret energy crisis talks the Davis administration disclosed Tuesday it may announce the framework of a pact to rescue the teetering Pacific Gas and Electric Co. next week. Things are going very well said Steve Maviglio a spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis. The state appears to be poised to pay at least $7 billion -- and possibly billions more -- for PG&E's high-voltage transmission lines as part of a deal to financially renovate the north-state utility according to sources familiar with the negotiations. But consumer advocates insisted that even the $7 billion price is too much to pay. And experts warned that a deal with PG&E will be more complex than with other utilities. PG&E representatives declined comment in keeping with their policy on the talks even though the Davis administration said an announcement could come as early as next week or the following week. The new timetable for an announcement was substantially sooner than in Davis' original forecast. Until late last week PG&E was still resisting the sale of its power grid despite the fact that Davis had announced the framework of an agreement with Southern California Edison. Davis expects to soon announce a similar deal with the San Diego Gas and Electric Co. However any such deal still would need federal approval. The investor-owned utilities trapped between high wholesale costs and lower regulated retail rates amassed nearly $13 billion in debts and were unable to buy electricity this winter. With the onset of rolling blackouts the state began brokering billions of dollars in emergency short- and long-term power purchases. Davis' strategy to ease the energy price and supply crisis includes bolstering both conservation and generation while fiscally refurbishing the nearly bankrupt utilities. As part of the rescue deal the utilities would have to drop legal actions seeking dramatically higher electricity bills environmentally shield wildlands they own sell power from their generators to Californians for the next decade and secure help with their debts from their parent companies. Together with the cash infusion from the sale of their power 26000-mile power grids the utilities would be allowed to sell bonds to raise funds and use customer money to pay them off. The state would upgrade the high-voltage lines and lease them back to the utilities for operation. In a reflection of the negotiations with the three utilities a Davis administration official said the deal with PG&E is proving to be more complex than with the other firms. Though PG&E finally agreed late last week to sell its transmission grid the utility apparently wants more than the $7 billion that Davis has offered according to sources. The figure is more than twice the book amount or the value placed on the system for purposes of accounting. And that's the markup that lured Edison into an agreement to sell its smaller portion of the transmission grid for $2.8 billion. But PG&E which fears an erosion of its economic base may be asking as much as $10 billion. Due to complexities in the state's 1996 deregulation of the industry PG&E is more likely to lose revenue than Edison as a result of selling its transmission lines according to experts. Big customers might be able to bypass the utility's remaining local distribution lines thereby eroding its customer base. Therefore the utility may view bankruptcy and sale of its transmission lines to the highest bidder as a potentially attractive alternative to selling its share of the grid to the state at too low a price. ---- El Paso Energy closes six valley power plants Filed: 03/07/2001 By CHIP POWER Californian staff writer e-mail: ppower@bakersfield.com El Paso Energy citing non-payment from Pacific Gas & Electric Co. said it has shut down six cogeneration plants this week. The smaller plants produced about 175 megawatts of electricity and are located primarily in the San Joaquin Valley said company spokesman Mel Scott. A megawatt can supply power to 1000 homes. At least 10 plants have closed in the past two weeks as a result of non-payment according to the state Independent System Operator which manages most of the state's electrical distribution. The El Paso Energy plants are operated with various partners and had not been compensated for December January and February deliveries said Scott. He said he did not know the total amount due but said the plants would be closed until PG&E's credit worthiness is improved. A cogeneration plant common in oil fields simultaneously produces heat energy and electrical or mechanical power from the same fuel in the same facility. Typically it produces electricity and steam which can be deployed to enhance oil recovery. Kern County is the state's leading oil-producing county. El Paso owns or has interests in more than 40000 miles of interstate and intrastate pipeline connecting the nation's principal natural gas supply regions to the five largest consuming regions in the United States namely the Gulf Coast California the Northeast the Midwest and the Southeast. El Paso closed up 99 cents on Tuesday or 1.4 percent at $71.49. The Houston-based company's stock price has ranged between $36.31 and $75.30 in the last 52 weeks. ---- Still undecided: Who'll pay DWR for electricity By Karen Gaudette ASSOCIATED PRESS SAN FRANCISCO -- The price tag is $3.2 billion and counting for electricity bought by the state Department of Water Resources for the customers of two nearly bankrupt utilities. Pacific Gas and Electric Co. Southern California Edison and the state disagree over how the DWR eventually will be reimbursed for its purchases on the expensive last-minute power market. So do the state power regulators who have the final call over who gets the money when. Under a recent law the DWR went into the electricity-buying business to help keep the two utilities from sinking further into their $13 billion debt. The state plans to retrieve the money by selling $10 billion in revenue bonds. The utilities continue to collect ratepayer dollars on that electricity which the bill's author Assemblyman Fred Keeley D-Boulder Creek says is meant to help them begin paying down their debt. In a recent letter however DWR officials requested that the state Public Utilities Commission order that a portion of that money be diverted to the state. But after the utilities subtract the costs of generating electricity payments to environmentally friendly power plants and other expenses there is no money left from ratepayer dollars to give to the DWR without sinking further into debt PG&E spokesman Ron Low said Tuesday. If it passed along money to the DWR our undercollection would grow by about $2.4 billion by the end of the year Low said. The commission unable to agree on the best course of action left the issue untouched at its last meeting but expects to revisit the issue when it meets this morning. Commissioner Richard Bilas is proposing an alternate plan that would have the DWR set its own revenue requirements that would be passed on to ratepayers. The PUC also is expected to respond to complaints from laid-off workers and customers that layoffs by utilities to cut costs have been hurting service. Commissioner Carl Wood warned at the last meeting that failure to provide safe and reliable service could mean fines for the utilities. Representatives from electrical workers unions the PUC and the utilities were to discuss the issue Tuesday afternoon. I don't think we believe that utilities can find a way out of their problems by laying off workers said Mindy Spatt a spokeswoman with the Utility Reform Network. We think consumers deserve safe and reliable service and we think they deserve it at a reasonable price. ---- State Taxpayers In Dark on Details Of Energy Deal David Lazarus Chronicle Staff Writer Wednesday March 7 2001 2001 San Francisco Chronicle Few people would purchase a car simply because the dealer said ''Trust me it's a great deal.'' Yet Gov. Gray Davis essentially is telling Californians just that about dozens of long-term power contracts. Because of confidentiality agreements with power companies the governor has revealed only scant details about the state's multibillion-dollar contracts for electricity over the next 10 years. Gov. Davis has our money and we can't see how he's spending it said Doug Heller a spokesman for the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in Santa Monica. We've been locked out of the room. Neither Davis nor power companies would divulge specific details about the price duration or scope of individual contracts. Each cited secrecy clauses that the governor's office said had been desired by both sides. What consumers do know is this: -- California has signed 40 contracts and tentative accords valued at about $40 billion to secure enough power to light 9 million homes over the next decade. -- The average purchase price of each deal is $69 per megawatt hour -- well above the $30 to $40 charged by power generators before California's energy market went haywire last summer. -- If as is widely expected wholesale power prices fall in years ahead the state nevertheless will be locked into paying above-market rates for electricity. But it is not known which generator agreed to part with the most power at the cheapest level or the full range of the prices in concocting the $69 average. Moreover it is unclear how shrewdly the state negotiated with taxpayer money in securing power on behalf of cash-strapped utilities. These agreements are the bedrock of our long-term energy policy Davis said Monday in announcing the deals. The governor's office defended the murky nature of the contracts yesterday. It's a business transaction in which private corporate information is included said Steve Maviglio a spokesman for Davis. That's the kind of information that never gets revealed. While additional elements of the contracts will be publicized in coming months he said the contracts themselves will remain a secret. You'll never see all the details Maviglio said. This did not sit well with many observers. It's a breach of public trust said Daniel Bacon a San Francisco attorney specializing in business law. A public servant spending public money shouldn't be able to keep the spending secret. But Gary Ackerman executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum an energy-industry association in Menlo Park called confidentiality agreements a necessary evil in transactions like this. He explained that no power company would agree to a long-term contract if rival firms could learn the terms of the accord. The company would be losing too much of its competitive edge in the marketplace Ackerman said. At the same time he noted that secrecy allowed the buyer -- in this case California taxpayers -- to secure more favorable terms with individual sellers. A high price with one generator would not necessarily be sought by all power providers. Still the fact that public funds are being used makes confidentiality in this case a different matter than say Cisco Systems' quietly negotiating to take over yet another tech rival. The public is in a very awkward position said Michael Shames executive director of the Utility Consumers' Action Network in San Diego. It has to rely on the good word and expertise of the governor and he has yet to demonstrate that he has expertise or good word in this field. Shames likened consumers to passengers in a plane being flown by a pilot without a license to fly. But what choice do we have? he asked. I don't see many other options available right now. There's the rub. No matter how bad a deal California may have cut to help meet its energy demands the alternative -- blackouts disruptions economic catastrophe -- is far far worse. On the other hand it already appears that the new contracts will not shield Californians from the threat of daily outages this summer when demand surges. Davis said only about 60 percent of the state's summertime electricity needs so far had been met. Part of the reason is that many power companies already have contracted for their output this year. Duke Energy said this was why it would not begin its nine-year contract with California until 2002 while Williams Cos. said it would only gradually increase the amount of available wattage in its 10-year contract. Both companies meanwhile will continue to profit this summer by selling into the volatile spot market where wholesale power went for as much as $1 500 per megawatt hour last year. You can't sell all your power into long-term contracts said Paula Hall- Collins a Williams spokeswoman. You save some for the spot market. Consumer groups worry that consumers will be hammered again this summer with sky-high power prices and then get nailed down the road by contracts for above-market rates. If we could look at the terms of the deals we'd see that California is being gouged for 10 years said Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights. But the governor doesn't want us to see that. Ackerman of the Western Power Trading Forum said the state had gotten the best rates it could under current market conditions. California went for long-term contracts when everyone else moved in as well he said. Californians are paying a price for not acting sooner. ---- Lawmakers pitch fixes for region's energy woes By David Whitney Bee Washington Bureau (Published March 7 2001) WASHINGTON -- California members of Congress pleaded for everything from wholesale price caps to extending daylight-saving time an extra hour to help the region cope this summer with its persistent electricity shortage but none of the ideas seemed to catch fire at a House hearing Tuesday. People will die in California because of this crisis Rep. Brad Sherman a Los Angeles-area Republican warned the House Energy and Commerce Committee. Sherman testified that his idea for saving lives is to extend daylight-saving time by an extra hour so that there would be more daylight at the end of the day when power consumption surges. One of the peak demand periods for electricity occurs between 5 p.m. and 8 p.m. when the sun sets and people come home from work Sherman testified. If people come home and it is light out there is less of an inclination to turn a light on. Sherman said the state Legislature has called for congressional approval for states to be given authority to extend daylight-saving time and he cited analyses by the California Energy Commission and other agencies suggesting that it could cut power consumption by 1 percent to 2 percent. Sherman who was one of about a dozen California lawmakers presenting their views on the energy squeeze drew no questions from committee leaders about what his legislation might do to everything from airline schedules to television programming if West Coast states didn't agree on the same time standard. Most of the committee's questioning was on the more popular idea proposed by several California and Western lawmakers primarily Democrats to require the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to impose caps on wholesale electricity prices that have gone wild because of a regional power shortage. Rep. Bob Filner D-San Diego charged that the price spiral has little to do with power shortages but a lot to do with a small cartel of generators bilking ratepayers. Rep. Jay Inslee D-Wash. said he brought up the idea of regional price caps with President Bush who was initially skeptical. But Inslee said that Bush warmed to the idea after being told that protections could be built into the caps so as not to discourage construction of new power plants. Upon hearing that Inslee said Bush invited him to meet with the president's Cabinet-level task force led by Vice President Dick Cheney on a national energy strategy. But Inslee said he can't get the group to meet with him. It's very disappointing Inslee said. Tuesday's hearing was part of a series the panel is holding on the California crisis so far without any emerging consensus on what if anything Congress should do. ---- Power plan called wrong Wall Street analysts say the governor's approach to the problem avoids the issue that caused the imbalance. March 7 2001 By DON THOMPSON The Associated Press SACRAMENTO California's scramble to insulate consumers from the soaring price of electricity may add to the state's power problems this summer Wall Street analysts said Tuesday. Gov. Gray Davis' emphasis on buying utilities' transmission lines and negotiating long-term power contracts to help ease their debts skirts the deep imbalance between wholesale and market rates that led to the state's power problems in the first place they said. In the long run it doesn't solve anything said Michael Worms an industry analyst for Gerard Klauer Mattison & Co. In the long run you need to send the right price signals to consumers which will create its own conservation signals. Unfortunately customers were shielded from that in California. Davis said Monday that the state's first contracts to buy electricity for two financially struggling utilities will provide only about two-thirds of the power needed on a typical summer day forcing Californians to cut power use at least 10 percent to avoid blackouts. Since early January the state has been buying one- third of the power Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric Co. customers need. The two utilities denied credit by suppliers say they have lost nearly $14 billion due to soaring wholesale electricity prices that the state's industry-deregulation law says they cannot pass on to consumers. The keepers of the state power grid had enough electricity Tuesday to avoid declaring an electricity alert but have faced an almost-daily scramble for weeks due to a tight supply and high wholesale prices. Several wholesale and retail rate proposals are circulating. Among them: Free-market advocates such as Worms want an immediate end to the deregulation-imposed retail rate freeze on Edison and PG&E that will expire next year. Davis wants a Western price cap of $100 per megawatt hour on power generators he says have been prof iteering from California's short energy supply. The Bush administration and Federal Energy Regulatory Commission are cool to that idea. In December FERC imposed a soft cap of $150 per megawatt hour on wholesale rates in the state and required suppliers to justify any higher prices they charge. Consumer groups such as The Utility Reform Network or TURN want regulated rates for residential and small-business customers but free-market rates for large industrial customers which sought deregulation in the first place. TURN also advocates a tiered rate structure with higher rates for consumers who use more than a reasonable amount of electricity each month. Assembly Republicans say electricity and natural-gas prices will fall naturally if the state increases supply mainly by making it easier to build plants and pipelines. Right now you're sort of sitting partially with regulation and part with the free market said Paul Fremont an analyst with Jefferies & Co. Both these systems work. It's sort of that in-between system that you have in Califor nia that doesn't appear to be working. The system discourages generators from building new power plants because they aren't guaranteed a profit and it doesn't do enough to discourage power use by consumers because the price they pay doesn't reflect the true cost of power Fremont said. I don't think people here have much faith in the market and why should they? countered TURN's Mindy Spatt. I think there are probably better ways of encouraging consumers to conserve than by gouging them. Davis insists the crisis can be resolved without raising rates for Edison and PG&E customers beyond the existing rate structure. In January state regulators imposed temporary rate hikes of 7 to 15 percent on Edison and PG&E customers. The Legislature and Davis extended the increases for up to a decade to help pay back the estimated $10 billion in power buying the state expects to do for Edison and PG&E over the next several years and finance its purchase of the power lines owned by the two companies and San Diego Gas & Electric. Rates were already scheduled to increase next year for Edison and PG&E customers. Under the 1996 deregulation law the pair's ratepayers saw a 10 percent rate reduction but only until early 2002. That rate cut will likely expire as planned Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio has said. Davis wants those rates to cover not only the traditional cost of generating transporting and distributing power but the added cost of paying off the two utilities' massive debt and buying their transmission lines said Assemblyman Fred Keeley D-Boulder Creek the Assembly's chief power negotiator. Yet Davis has indirectly addressed the rate imbalance by signing legislation that will let regulators raise consumer rates if necessary Keeley said. The governor and lawmakers are in effect spreading out rate increases over a decade by using long-term revenue bonds to buy power for the nearly bankrupt utilities said Severin Borenstein director of the University of California Energy Institute. At some point we have to deal with the reality that all of the power that we buy has to be paid for by somebody - it's either going to come from taxpayers or it's going to come from ratepayers Bor enstein said. Raising rates now would get us a lot of conservation. Davis also wants financial incentives for conservation and power-plant construction in time to make a difference this summer. Our mouths were agape at the rapid timetable Keeley said. Legislators are rushing to pass those incentives by month's end he said allowing three months for consumers and suppliers to act before the heat of summer. Among bills considered Tuesday the Senate Energy Committee approved legislation to accelerate the siting of power plants. It also was considering a proposal to restructure rates for generators that use renewable energy to provide about 30 percent of the state's electricity. ---- Bill to Cut Some Power Prices Stalls Energy: Democrats balk at varying payment levels for alternative generators. By DAN MORAIN JULIE TAMAKI Times Staff Writers SACRAMENTO--Legislation aimed at cutting prices for more than a fourth of the power consumed in California stalled Tuesday as Democrats questioned why a few alternative energy generators--some of them campaign donors--stood to receive higher payments than others. Lawmakers working to unravel California's energy mess have been negotiating for weeks in an effort to cut the price paid to more than 600 generators of alternative power by more than half to below 8 cents a kilowatt-hour. Those alternative generators' contracts with utilities have shot up in recent months because of a rise in the price of natural gas. The cash-strapped corporations have suspended or made partial payments to the generators over the last few months causing many to shut down or reduce their outputs. But even as the lawmakers reached agreement that pushed the average price to near the 8-cent level per kilowatt-hour some generators would have received higher prices under the bill by state Sen. Jim Battin (R-La Quinta). Some of the generators that stood to benefit had donated to Battin's campaigns. One--Windtec Inc.--gave Battin a $20000 campaign donation in 1999. Others contributed from $3000 and $5000 last year. Battin acknowledged that he has received campaign contributions from some wind power generators but said there is no connection between the donations and the bill's provisions. It is illegal it is unethical and it's not how I do business he said. Battin noted that 25% of the state's alternative energy producers are in his district. As Democrats on the Senate Energy Committee blocked the bill Battin warned that some alternative energy producers might react to the delay by trying to force Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric into bankruptcy. We will be the cause of bankruptcy Battin said. That prompted Energy Committee Chairwoman Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey) to retort: I'm really tired of being threatened with bankruptcy. Alternative energy producers including those that use wind solar power biomass and other means produce 27% of the energy used in California. They sell the electricity to the utilities which in turn transmit it to retail consumers. But with the utilities facing multibillion-dollar debts the alternative energy producers under contract with Edison have not been paid since November. Scores of alternative energy producers supported the measure. Edison International and the San Francisco-based consumer group the Utility Reform Network opposed it. Michael Florio of the Utility Reform group said the deal could result in higher consumer prices an Edison representative said the same thing. Battin and Assemblyman Fred Keeley (D-Boulder Creek) worked out an arrangement with many of the generators. Keeley took the lead in the early negotiations and then turned to Battin to introduce the legislation SB 47X. Rather convoluted language would have allowed higher payments to a select few generators that produce electricity from wind and biomass. Most of California's wind suppliers for instance would have received about 6 cents per kilowatt-hour. But a handful of them about half a dozen wind farms--mostly in the Palm Springs area represented by Battin--would have received 7.8 cents. Battin contends that other wind producers receive additional payments that boost them to the same level as Windtec and others that would get the higher payments. They get the same deal Battin said of the handful of generators that would benefit from the provisions he added to the bill. In California's overall energy market the amount of money that would have flowed to the favored generators is minor. But the added prices that would have been paid to the generators would have translated to at least $19 million in the next five years to be absorbed by Southern California Edison customers according to one analysis. Also Tuesday more details were disclosed about another leg of the state's effort to escape from the energy crunch--the deals with large power generators to supply electricity to California for as long as 10 years. Those arrangements were announced by Gov. Gray Davis Monday as the bedrock of California's energy policy. But some consumer advocates warned that the deals could lock the state into excessively high-priced contracts. S. David Freeman the general manager of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and Davis' negotiator said that the state guarded against that by varying the time spans of its deals. About 6000 megawatts are expected to be available this summer about one-third of the energy needed by the state Freeman said. The amount of power under contract swells until more than 9000 megawatts are contracted in 2004 half of the needed amount before dipping to 8000 megawatts in 2010. What we're doing here is what everybody said had to be done Freeman said. We deliberately bought 50% so we'd have a good mix between long-term contracts which may turn out to be somewhat higher or somewhat lower than the spot market and purchases on the spot market. ---- PG&E could face mutiny on outages: SMUD others may balk if utility orders summer blackouts By Carrie Peyton Bee Staff Writer (Published March 7 2001) Sacramento's electric utility wants out of a deal that imposes rolling blackouts locally on PG&E's command. So do a lot of other utilities. They've been writing letters lobbying lawmakers and launching informal talks with Pacific Gas and Electric Co. to get off the hook before summer. Who dodges the blackout bullet is going to play out as a political hot button around the state said George Fraser head of the Northern California Power Agency a coalition of municipal utilities. In Sacramento the next volley is expected soon with the Sacramento Municipal Utility District reportedly poised to notify PG&E that it will no longer black out homes and businesses on the larger utility's command. We are absolutely trying to fight off the requirement for rolling blackouts for the Sacramento area said Linda Davis one of seven elected members of the SMUD board of directors. Saying they don't want to be dragged down by somebody else's problems two Southern California utilities have written grid operators asking to be exempted from any blackouts caused by PG&E's or Southern California Edison's financial woes. But in PG&E's view California is in an energy crisis (and) ... we're all in this together said spokesman John Nelson. The maneuvering comes amid bleak forecasts for power supplies this summer. Although Gov. Gray Davis has said conservation new power plants and moderate weather could avert blackouts officials at the Independent System Operator which runs much of California's grid expect frequent rotating outages. One consulting firm Cambridge Energy Research Associates predicts 20 hours of rolling blackouts during July and August and about 200 hours of especially intense calls for voluntary cutbacks. Before blackouts hit the jockeying over just whose lights air conditioners and assembly lines will be shut down is growing. The outcome could affect millions of people statewide. The state Public Utilities Commission is probing rolling blackout programs run by the for-profit utilities it regulates including PG&E and Edison. A PUC analysis has suggested that PG&E's program which currently exempts about 40 percent of its customers should spread the burden more broadly. For example it said 1.9 million homes and businesses are spared just because they share a circuit with a customer deemed essential. But not-for-profit utilities such as SMUD which answer to their own elected boards or city councils have other worries. Many have already lined up their power supplies for summer. Some have raised rates or are considering raising rates. Some have taken extra conservation steps. They think those preparations ought to give them leverage to ease blackout clauses in their contracts with PG&E. SMUD general manager Jan Schori is going to use every avenue ... any avenue to put pressure on including lobbying the ISO the governor and others said utility director Davis. The Northern California Power Agency a joint-powers authority that owns and operates power plants for municipal utilities has begun informal negotiations with PG&E to change blackout rules according to Fraser its top executive. It is preparing to write PG&E asking that its members be exempted from outages altogether. Failing that it wants them to face fewer outages or to be compensated for cutting off power he said. At SMUD the utility board has met in closed session to discuss exactly what it is required to do during electric emergencies under terms of the interconnection contract that links SMUD's lines to PG&E's. The contracts are being inspected with a fine-tooth comb said SMUD director Howard Posner. Schori declined to comment on any specifics. Sources indicated that the main option being considered is notifying PG&E that because of changed circumstances SMUD believes it no longer is required to routinely comply with outage requests. Other options being explored include re-negotiating existing agreements with PG&E. Posner said that ever since two days of rolling blackouts in January constituents have been asking him  'Why are we participating when we're not the problem?' And I don't have a good answer to that. Several directors said SMUD has already spent a lot of money -- and is considering 16 percent rate increases -- to ensure that it has enough electricity under contract to meet its customers' summer demands. They believe PG&E should do the same. We're almost like a David against Goliath here said board vice president Genevieve Shiroma. The huge investor-owned utilities next door have severe problems that they need to get under control. In addition SMUD plans to argue that because it can cut usage through its Peak Corps program which remotely turns off air conditioners at volunteer households it has already done its part without rotating outages director Davis said. PG&E believes the interconnection agreements that govern smaller utilities' ties to its transmission lines have benefits and burdens to both sides said Nelson. It wouldn't be fair or good policy for just one provision to be altered without taking a look at how that affects the entire contract he said. Interconnection contracts generally have clauses that require utilities to help each other out to avert greater emergencies. Sometimes reducing demand -- called load shedding -- can be the only way to stabilize the electric grid in the seconds after a major power plant or transmission line fails. It's been around in the electrical fabric forever said Jim Pope head of Silicon Valley Power Santa Clara's city-run utility. In addition to legal requirements you have a moral obligation so you don't bring the system to collapse. Like other city-run utilities Silicon Valley Power has a contract with PG&E that requires it to shed load during an electric emergency. But its contract allows it to work with big users to reduce their demand so no one has to be completely shut off. Such agreements formed long before deregulation when PG&E ran the north state's grid now are complicated by the 1997 creation of the state Independent System Operator. The ISO today runs pieces of the grid owned by PG&E Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric Co. If it believes power use is about to surge past supply potentially triggering a grid collapse across the western United States the ISO notifies the three utilities that they have to shed a certain number of megawatts. The big utilities meet that requirement two ways. They cut circuits to some of their own customers and they tell smaller connected utilities to cut a proportionate share. In Northern California about 80 percent of the outages are borne by PG&E customers and the rest by customers of SMUD and other municipal utilities and irrigation districts. In one sense we are all in this together. If SMUD were in danger of going down we would hope others would help us out said SMUD's Posner. But that's if we're in danger from circumstances beyond our control not from mismanagement or lack of financial wherewithal. It is unclear what penalties if any a utility would face for violating an interconnection agreement. In the long run the issue would be fought either in the courts or before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission grid officials said. As a practical matter in the seconds when the risk to the grid is greatest if one utility refused to shed load the ISO would probably solve to problem by calling on PG&E Edison or others who are willing to make deeper cutbacks they said. ---- PUC to Decide Fate Of Utility Workers PG&E Edison want to trim costs by laying off thousands cutting service Bernadette Tansey Chronicle Staff Writer Wednesday March 7 2001 2001 San Francisco Chronicle State regulators are set to decide today whether debt-ridden Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern California Edison can conserve cash by laying off thousands of workers and letting service standards slip. Union officials who protested the layoffs before the California Public Utilities Commission warn that if the cuts go through neighborhoods hit by power outages could stay dark for hours and more customers could face busy signals when they call about their bills. An administrative law judge agreed advising the commission in February to order the utilities to restore 725 positions already cut and block the elimination of an additional 2125 jobs. Judge John Wong said PG&E and Edison have acknowledged the layoffs will not substantially improve their shaky financial condition which arose from skyrocketing wholesale electricity costs the utilities could not pass on to consumers under a rate cap. The savings would barely make a dent Wong said in his draft decision. The two companies together claim that their debt from power purchases amounts to more than $13 billion. PG&E says it has saved $18 million from the first wave of 325 layoffs. Wong's recommendation is already running into resistance on the PUC. Commissioner Richard Bilas said the five-member panel should not be micromanaging the utilities in a time of crisis. Bilas has proposed an alternate ruling that would allow the utilities to make the cuts but provide for PUC monitoring of service in case the commission wants to step in later. We're in a situation where the utilities are not collecting the revenues they need to operate and yet we may be guilty of not letting them cut expenses where they can cut expenses Bilas said. PG&E spokesman Jon Tremayne said savings from the layoffs are helping to keep electricity running and gas flowing. It keeps cash in our accounts so we can keep doing day-to-day business Tremayne said. In addition to the 325 positions dropped so far PG&E is proposing to cut an additional 675 during the next three to six months. The cuts affect temporary and contract workers who read meters handle new service hookups and replace equipment. PG&E has no plans to eliminate permanent positions. The company is struggling to keep up with a higher workload at its call center as customers deluge the lines with inquiries about their rising bills and the effects of deregulation. Calls to PG&E ballooned from 1.3 million in January 2000 to 2.3 million in January 2001. Bilas advocates granting PG&E's request to temporarily relax standards requiring the utility to respond swiftly to customer calls and to read customers' meters once a month. PG&E wants to read meters bimonthly and send bills based on the estimated use between readings. Discrepancies could be corrected later. Wong called those measures unacceptable. He said customers need to know immediately if their efforts to conserve power are working. Wong also said the utilities' own experts have said the workforce reductions will lengthen the time required to restore power after nonemergency equipment failure. Eric Wolfe communications director for the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 1245 said some customers have already been left without power overnight because PG&E is trying to avoid the use of overtime on nonemergency power outages. It hurts a lineman to walk away from the job leaving a customer without power Wolfe said. Tremayne said PG&E is trying to minimize overtime costs but denied the company has allowed customers to go without power out of financial concerns. He said crews were pulled out when darkness and falling trees made the work too dangerous. ---- Power prices could soar during the summer Posted at 10:35 p.m. PST Tuesday March 6 2001 BY STEVE JOHNSON Mercury News Unless Gov. Gray Davis arranges significantly more long-term electricity contracts or persuades people to turn off a lot more lights California's unpredictable spot market for power could wreak havoc this summer. Even with the 40 long-term deals announced by Davis on Monday experts interviewed Tuesday said up to 43 percent of the state's daily needs may have to come from this highly volatile market in which power is bought within a day of need. That could could prove hugely expensive because some spot market energy has cost five to six times what it would under the long-term contracts. It's widely expected that consumers ultimately would have to pay that tab which could amount to billions of dollars. And because that power won't be locked up in contracts there is no guarantee it will be available when it's needed which could lead to blackouts according to a recent report to the California Independent System Operator which oversees three-fourths of the state's power grid. ``The situation in California could reach catastrophic proportions'' the report concluded adding that unless things change dramatically ``it is a virtual certainty that peak demand will go unmet during many hot summer days.'' Steven Maviglio Davis' press secretary conceded Tuesday that the spot market could be troublesome. ``It's a major concern'' he said which is why the state is trying to line up more power contracts speed up power plant construction and promote conservation. During the normally hot month of August peak daily demand for power in the Independent System Operator's territory is expected to hit about 47700 megawatts -- enough for nearly 48 million homes. The state's three main utility firms generate about 8200 megawatts and have long-term contracts from wind solar and other energy sources for about 11700 megawatts more. That totals about 20000 megawatts. Add in the 7000 megawatts of long-term power that Davis has announced for this summer and the state is still nearly 21000 megawatts short. Costly proposition If all that power has to be obtained on the spot market the price could be high. On Friday last-minute purchases on the market averaged $411 per megawatt-hour compared to about $150 per megawatt-hour for all power obtained by the Independent System Operator and $69 per megawatt-hour on average under Davis' long-term contracts. It's possible that not all 21000 megawatts would have to be purchased on the market. Assuming Davis is successful in getting people to save 10 percent -- which could prove difficult -- conservation could reduce peak demand by nearly 5000 megawatts. California also might be able to trade for another 5000 megawatts with the federal government's Bonneville Power Administration and a hydroelectric operator in British Columbia said Arthur O'Donnell editor of California Energy Markets a trade publication. Under such deals those two outfits often send that much power to California when they don't need it and California returns the same amount or more when its demand is low. But O'Donnell said it wasn't clear whether 5000 megawatts would be available this summer because ``they still haven't gotten the snowpack they need in the Pacific Northwest'' which could limit that region's generating capacity. Still falling short Even if those hydropower imports are available and conservation works as Davis hopes it's likely California would still require the spot market for 11000 megawatts to meet the August demand. That's more than 20 percent of the state's overall power needs. ``All of the surrounding states are buying probably less than 5 percent at most of their energy on the spot market'' said Frank Wolak a Stanford economist who monitors electricity prices for the Independent System Operator. He worries about how much that power could cost and is disturbed that state officials haven't adequately addressed the issue. ``No one has any idea what they are going to do and that is part of the problem'' he said. Officials at Pacific Gas & Electric Co. are particularly concerned. They fear that their company -- which is nearing bankruptcy -- could get stuck for much of the spot market purchases by the Independent System Operator which has threatened to bill the utilities for the cost. Fearing the annual bill for that power could hit $2.4 billion this year PG&E wants the tab sent to the Department of Water Resources which also is buying power on the spot market for the state. But the Department of Water Resources has objected to that idea and the matter is expected to be heard today by the California Public Utilities Commission. ``We're looking for clarity on a number of issues'' regarding how the spot market will work ``and certainly that's one of them'' said Thomas Hannigan the water agency's director. ``I don't think anybody knows the answer of who's going to pay for it'' added PG&E spokesman John Nelson. But Nettie Hoge executive director of the Utility Reform Network in San Francisco said she suspects consumers ultimately will foot the bill. The unfortunate likelihood about spot market purchases is that ``ratepayers are responsible for all of it eventually'' Hoge said. ``It's a very big problem.'' ---- Power Plant Plans Cause Conflicts East county residents blast supervisors Jason B. Johnson Chronicle Staff Writer Wednesday March 7 2001 Industry dreams of building new power plants in east Contra Costa's hills are prompting an angry reaction among residents and elected officials who say they don't want more plants. The conflict was sparked by a vote by county supervisors yesterday to aggressively explore possible sites for new power plants throughout the county. The measure by Supervisors Mark DeSaulnier and Federal Glover which passed on a 4-to-0 vote directs the county administrator and Department of Community Development to compile a report on possible sites within 45 days. Supervisor Donna Gerber abstained after criticizing the plan for potentially repeating the same mistakes that plagued the state's energy deregulation effort by not considering how much energy the state region and county will need in future years and how much power is slated to come online. Gerber said alternative power sources such as solar should also be examined. A site drawing much attention is on top of a deposit of natural gas near the Concord Naval Weapons Station off Highway 4. The owners of 70 acres of land near the station recently formed a company Golden State Power Co. to pursue construction of at least one small peaker plant and a much larger facility capable of producing 600 megawatts. The site could hold up to three small 50-megawatt peaker plants and a larger 15-acre natural gas plant said Steve Thomas managing partner with Golden State. No land use applications have been filed. Thomas said 30 acres could be kept as open space to form a buffer around the project. Both (facilities) are state of the art said Thomas. We believe that the site is ideal. But east county residents at yesterday's meeting blasted the supervisorial measure and the power plant proposal complaining that more plants could put people's health at risk. The region already is home to six power plants. We're going to get a good dose of poor air quality and (negative) health conditions from this said Concord resident Evelyn Frietas. I think we need to stop and think about what we're doing to our quality of life. Dan Torres said the home he bought in 1995 at a new Bay Point development would be alarmingly close to the proposed Golden State site. It will be dragging emissions over our home said Torres. I didn't buy a home on that hill to be surrounded by power plants. There are six power plants in operation in east Contra Costa. Pittsburg already has two power plants and two more under construction. City Council members Frank Aiello and Yvonne Beals said the Antioch-Pittsburg area has done more than its share of energy production. Aiello said Pittsburg will soon produce enough energy to power three million homes in California. When is enough enough? asked Aiello. Pittsburg has shouldered responsibility for a land-fill and two more power plants. At some point you have to say enough. Beals said that while power plants have added millions to the city's general fund the negatives of additional plants could outweigh the benefits. I don't think that Pittsburg or east county should be the dumping ground for energy for California said Beals. ---- Supervisors set search for power plant sites The board also heard from the potential developers of a 650-megawatt plant between Bay Point and Concord By Thomas Peele TIMES STAFF WRITER MARTINEZ -- Contra Costa County supervisors took tentative steps Tuesday toward allowing the construction of at least one small power plant before summer ordering that its staff identify potential sites in unincorporated areas within seven weeks. The board voted 4-0 to search for locations. Third District Supervisor Donna Gerber abstained saying her colleagues lacked a comprehensive context'' to identify sites. I think the board knows just enough to be dangerous'' she said. Gerber said the county should examine the potential for additional power plants within its borders but not investigate individual sites yet. But Fourth District Supervisor Mark DeSaulnier said the action was necessary because of the energy crisis and because of Gov. Gray Davis' call for local governments to help speed the construction of so-called peaker plants before July and August. I wouldn't do this except under an emergency DeSaulnier said after the vote. There are unusual circumstances. We're not talking about putting this in a residential area. Fifth District Supervisor Federal Glover backed DeSaulnier but said he hoped for a location outside his heavily industrialized East County district. There's a lot of concern in East County as to the number of plants he said. DeSaulnier said though that the only logical place for a small plant remains the industrial belt'' stretching along the waterfront from West County to Antioch. He declined to provide specifics but said the only other potential site outside the industrial areas was the Concord Naval Weapons Station property. But he quickly added that he believes the U.S. Department of Defense would never go for it. Also DeSaulnier said he could not rule out the county building the plant itself and entering the electricity-selling market during peak demand times. Board Chairwoman Gayle Uilkema called that idea extremely premature and unlikely. That's a very powerful decision. I do not think we are ready'' she said. The California Energy Commission listed the Equilon refinery in Martinez as one of 32 potential peaker plant sites in the state last week. Peaker plants kick in during peak usage times. Davis called for their quick construction before the height of summer and its energy demand for air conditioning. Plants that generate as much as 50000 megawatts don't need Energy Commission approval. DeSaulnier said he believed a peaker plant could be built about a month after final approval. Supervisors also heard from the potential developers of a 650-megawatt plant between Bay Point and Concord. Walnut Creek commercial real estate developer Steve Thomas announced his intentions for the site north of Highway 4 last week. Construction could take two years. Eric Hasseltine a consultant representing Thomas and what he described as a brand new company for the site the Golden State Power Co. told supervisors that if they intended to speed peaker plant construction they should do what they can to expedite the larger plant. The Thomas site could house a peaker plant until the proposed larger one goes online. A large natural gas line passes under the site. DeSaulnier seemed cautious about the larger proposal which he had described last week as a good site. Uilkema too said she knew too little about it to comment. A resident who lives near the Thomas property asked the board to build it (the larger plant) closer to where you have industrial areas. You have to carefully consider the people who live nearby said Dan Torres 39. Evelyn Freitas of Concord said she lives downwind of the proposed site. Our air quality is going to be worse then it is now she said. Gerber played on the environmental issues saying the county already ranks second statewide to Los Angeles in volume of hazardous materials and amount of electrical generation. ---- Peter Schrag: California's $90 billion infrastructure gap (Published March 7 2001) By now California's surreal energy mess has grown from a crisis to a condition. It may not be quite as permanent as say death and taxes but it's still something that could get a whole lot worse before it gets better. Until there's more realistic pricing no gubernatorial pea-under-the-shell buyout scheme will solve it. Beyond the energy crisis however and in many ways similar to it California faces a whole range of other infrastructure problems -- in transportation in water resources and sewer systems in school and university buildings -- that seem once again to be all but forgotten. The Business Roundtable has estimated the need at roughly $90 billion though no number can possibly be exact. What's certain is that after a burst of high-level investment in public facilities during the 1950s and 1960s California's annual capital investment has sunk precipitously -- from an annual $150 per capita in the 1960s according to a set of recent studies for PPIC the Public Policy Institute of California to about $30 in the 1990s. But you probably don't need to tell anyone driving Bay Area or Los Angeles freeways or looking at the ubiquitous portable classrooms those dreary brown boxes that house a fourth of our public school students. Ever since passage of Proposition 13 in 1978 we have been flying the flag of deferred maintenance. As in the state's electricity crisis however there's no way California can effectively address those problems merely by building or bonding itself out of them. In highway construction in developing water resources in finding enough university space to accommodate the Tidal Wave II of students managing demand is likely to be as crucial to any solution as new construction. In the energy market -- and in electricity particularly -- it's been a familiar principle ever since David Roe of the Environmental Defense Fund first persuaded Pacific Gas and Electric that a dollar invested in conservation may be worth as much as the same investment in new generation. But in most other sectors of California's infrastructure state and local it's a lesson still to be learned. There have been scattered attempts to encourage conservation and reduce demand -- significant reduction in water use for example through the installation of low-flow faucets and low-flush toilets some reduction in traffic by using rush-hour diamond lanes or by adjusting highway or (as in New York) bridge tolls to levels of congestion. But as pointed out by David Dowall an urban economist at Berkeley state policy-makers have not really begun to consider how demand management strategies can be applied to infrastructure service areas or how the more efficient use of facilities and more realistic pricing -- highway tolls say or parking fees -- can reduce demand for scarce infrastructure resources. In any case says Dowall in one of the PPIC reports we should pick which major projects we will build not just according to per capita estimates of how much we need but according to how much consumers are willing to pay for them. To avoid hurting the poor congestion-related highway tolls and other tariffs can be rebated on the basis of income. University fees can be means-tested. In California they also could be adjusted to encourage summer school classes and other off-peak uses rather than (as in the past) making UC summer courses more expensive. Given the political and economic uncertainties there's no way to know how far such demand management can be taken. But there's not much doubt that as Dowall and others point out the state's infrastructure planning is a jumble of uncoordinated agency agendas and wish lists. The Legislature last year passed a bill AB 1473 by Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg that requires the governor beginning next year to submit an annual five-year infrastructure plan for state agencies and public schools along with recommendations on how to fund it. In addition Gov. Gray Davis' infrastructure commission is expected to recommend better coordination of infrastructure and land-use planning when it issues its report this spring. That would be a start. As California State Treasurer Phil Angelides has pointed out the state desperately needs to start joint planning -- regional planning -- for housing roads and other resources to reduce the need for long commutes to preserve open space and to bring jobs to where people live and housing to where the jobs are. That would itself reduce demand for more freeway lanes and equally important improve the quality of life. At present most planning for housing roads water systems and other facilities rarely recognizes the regional impact of local decisions. In the East Bay slow-growth forces push well-intended initiatives that would force more development into Tracy or Modesto and further tax the transportation systems to Silicon Valley. In city after city there are beggar-thy-neighbor efforts to grab yet another shopping mall that produces a little extra sales tax revenue for the city that gets it and that often compounds traffic and revenue problems in adjacent communities. In higher education we divide bond proceeds evenly among UC the California State University and the community colleges even though the community colleges serve eight times as many students as UC. We plan road projects according to county not regional priorities. It is all done according to antiquated political and fiscal formulas that often no longer make sense. We don't just need better capital planning we need a whole new planning system. ---- PG&E power plan debated at hearing A PUC meeting on the utility's capacity expansion project for the Tri-Valley follows weeks of protest from officials residents Power upgrade in valley debated By Megan Long TIMES STAFF WRITER SAN FRANCISCO -- Dublin officials and the developer of a Livermore subdivision faced questions Tuesday about their opposition to alternative routes of PG&E's controversial Tri-Valley power upgrade plan -- and answered by restating their long-standing objections. Tuesday's cross-examination came during the third and likely final week of the California Public Utility Commission's evidentiary hearings on the utility's $91 million Tri-Valley 2002 Capacity Increase Project. It has followed weeks of protests of PG&E's upgrade plans by officials and residents of Livermore Pleasanton Dublin and San Ramon. And before the questioning started Dublin Vice Mayor Janet Lockhart reiterated concerns about an alternative route deemed environmentally superior that would place a substation just 1000 feet north of Interstate 580 between Tassajara and Fallon roads. She said that would undermine the results of a 15-year process to plan the eastern development of the city. It's extremely important to the residents of our community to follow a plan we worked hard to produce she said. Dublin officials favor PG&E's proposed placement of the station three miles north of the freeway away from new high-tech company offices and housing developments. Besides the Dublin substation the project calls for construction of a substation in North Livermore expansion of the Pleasanton substation and installation of 23.5 miles of new lines. In response to questions from PUC Administrative Law Judge Michelle Cooke Dublin's public works director Lee Thompson confirmed that the Lin family the owner of the property where the alternative substation would go wasn't interested in selling the land to PG&E. Cooke also asked Thompson to define a discretionary permit which is how city officials said they might treat a permit for a substation. Lee said that type of permit is one the city has the right to approve or not depending on the project's impact. Eddie Peabody Dublin's community development director testified that the zoning for the Lin property accommodates uses such as commercial business research and development and light manufacturing. It would not he said be appropriate for a power substation. He said parcels within the East Dublin area that could host a station would include those zoned for public and semi-public uses including land recently bought by Oracle and Sun Microsystems for new campuses. While Dublin officials testified that one buyer of land in that area paid $86 per square foot others suggested land prices would be inflated to help make a PG&E land buy look prohibitively expensive. An executive of Centex Homes the developer of new houses near Isabel Avenue and Concannon Boulevard objected to an alternative route that would place high-voltage transmission lines overhead along Isabel and Stanley Boulevard. David Barclay president of Centex's Northern California division said that the 80-foot to 150-foot towers would have a severe visual impact on residents of the Prima tract. Ed O'Neill a lawyer for the Kottinger Ranch Homeowners Association pointed out that existing distribution lines on 50-foot poles on Isabel already mar the view for residents. The Foley family has been ranching on land south of Pleasanton city limits for years said their attorney Kennedy Richardson. The utility's project would place overhead lines and a transmission station on rolling hills that the family envisions as one day being public open space with limited development Richardson said. Lawyers for Pleasanton Livermore Kottinger Ranch and Centex are scheduled to cross-examine a PG&E engineer today about the project's routing. That testimony should be the most controversial of the hearings. Judge Cooke is expected to recommend an alignment by July to the PUC which will make the final decision. ---- NEWS State OKs 'Peaker' Power Plant at SFO / Temporary generator could be sending electricity to 50000 homes by August Marshall Wilson 03/08/2001 The San Francisco Chronicle FINAL Page A.20 (Copyright 2001) State energy officials yesterday approved plans to build a temporary electrical plant at San Francisco International Airport that should generate enough juice to power 50000 homes by August. Meeting in Sacramento the Energy Commission voted 4-0 to give the green light to the gas-fired plant. It will operate during peak summer and winter demand to help the state avoid Stage 3 power alerts and rolling blackouts. Texas-based El Paso Merchant Energy Co. won approval under a new state law mandating speedy four-month reviews of so-called peaker plants. It was the only one of seven applications statewide to win approval. The other proposals were withdrawn for various reasons. The 51-megawatt plant formally called the United Golden Gate Power Project is scheduled to be built at the northwest corner of the airport near the United Airlines maintenance center. Within the next few weeks El Paso plans to apply to build a 571- megawatt $400 million plant in the same area company spokesman Jesse Frederick said. It would undergo a separate review by state energy officials. The small peaker plant approved yesterday is to generate electricity beginning around Aug. 1 for up to three years. After the end of three years the plant would be closed or converted to a cleaner-burning system. Under state law a temporary peaker plant is permitted to spew more air pollution than a permanent plant. El Paso's temporary plant is to be built next to a co-generation plant operated by United Airlines. It would use existing connections for natural gas and water supplies and tap into existing power transmission lines. Electricity generated by the plant would be pumped into the state's electrical grid Energy Commission spokesman Gary Fay said. It would also serve as a backup for San Francisco Airport in case of a blackout. No one spoke against the proposed plant at yesterday's commission meeting. The proposal however has been criticized by area residents and environmentalists worried about air pollution. Scott Buschman a professional photographer and San Bruno resident said yesterday it was unjust that state officials 100 miles away in Sacramento approved a Texas company's proposal to put a power plant on land owned by San Francisco. The fact that they approved it without considering the public's concerns foremost air quality is very disturbing he said. Fay said the plant complies with clean-air standards. Answering the criticism about the location of yesterday's deliberation he said three hearings and several workshops were held in communities near the airport. Copyright  2000 Dow Jones & Company Inc. All Rights Reserved. ---- Crossed Wires: Major Kinks Emerge In Gov. Davis's Plan To Power California --- State's Outlays for Electricity May Be Hard to Recover Without Rate Increases --- Betting on Long-Term Deals By Wall Street Journal staff reporters Rebecca Smith Mitchel Benson and John R. Emshwiller 03/08/2001 The Wall Street Journal A1 (Copyright (c) 2001 Dow Jones & Company Inc.) SACRAMENTO Calif. -- Earlier this year Gov. Gray Davis made what may be the biggest bet in the history of the nation's biggest state: that he could tame an out-of-control electricity market and avoid devastating blackouts without busting the state's budget antagonizing its consumers or derailing his own political career. His wager is still on the table but the assumptions that underlie it are looking increasingly shaky these days. The governor has already spent around $2 billion of public money buying hugely expensive wholesale power taking over the role formerly played by the state's near-bankrupt electric utilities. And California will probably be obliged to spend billions more before its electricity market stabilizes and those utilities are restored to some semblance of financial health. Under the governor's plan California aims to recoup the money it is using to buy electricity by issuing $10 billion in bonds. That way it would still have a healthy budget surplus to finance new spending on roads schools and other public services. But there's a potentially big obstacle to this plan. The state Legislature worried about racking up billions in new debt has put limits on the size of any bond offering. In broad terms the Legislature's action would allow the state to borrow only four times as much as it can recover annually from utility customers. Right now that doesn't appear to be much. Under the current rate structure essentially set in place by California's flawed 1996 electricity-deregulation plan consumers pay far less for power than the cost of acquiring it on the wholesale market. Preliminary estimates submitted by utilities last month to the California Public Utilities Commission show the state's share of the proceeds from electricity sales this year could be as little as $241 million -- not enough to support even $1 billion in bond sales under the Legislature's formula. That would leave the state on the hook for much of the money it has already paid for power -- not to mention the billions more Gov. Davis will need to spend. That in turn raises the prospect that California's economy and its credit rating both could deteriorate significantly. But state finance officials say that based on their own projections they will be able to extract enough money to support a $10 billion bond issue. Walking a careful line between fiscal prudence and political survival Mr. Davis and others in his administration are scrambling to come up with ways to get around the legislative restrictions without raising rates for consumers. If I wanted to raise rates I could solve this problem in 20 minutes Mr. Davis says. The governor says he believes that the state can obtain enough affordable power through long-term power-supply contracts to avoid the need for a big rate increase. The billions of dollars the state hopes to borrow would be used to help pay for power until electricity prices drop as they are expected to do when new power plants come online over the next few years. The Davis administration fears that what may be its only other option -- a big increase in retail electric rates -- could prompt angry consumer groups to seek new electricity laws through a statewide ballot initiative during next year's election. That's when Mr. Davis is expected to run for a second term as governor. But trying to save California without rate increases is forcing Mr. Davis to make some colossal gambles with the state's money. State officials estimate that in the next several months California will need to spend as much as $6 billion on power purchases -- equivalent to the state's entire fiscal surplus. Mr. Davis is also looking to spend several billion more to buy the transmission assets of three investor-owned utilities in order to restore two of them to credit-worthiness. He also has announced plans to spend several hundred million dollars more on conservation programs designed to reduce demand while new power plants are being built in the state. In order to limit the state's financial exposure in the meantime the governor and his aides have in some cases ignored state law. They have threatened appointed officials who have stood in the way. And they have sharply restricted the flow of information to the public. None of those steps is expected to do much to reduce state spending on power in the coming months. In a few weeks power usage is expected to begin a sharp seasonal rise as Californians switch on their air conditioners with the coming of warmer weather. By various estimates demand during peak periods this summer could outstrip supply by 10% or several thousand megawatts. That could produce more rolling blackouts like the ones that hit Northern California earlier this year. It is also likely to put strong upward pressure on wholesale electricity prices. Steven Zimmerman managing director of Standard & Poor's Corp. says Mr. Davis and his aides don't have a lot of time to put a cap on the state's financial exposure to the crisis. The credit-rating agency has put the state on credit watch for a possible downgrade which would affect the value of all of California's outstanding public debt. Moody's Investor Service Inc. is also concerned. It said in a recent report that the power crisis could soon seriously threaten the health of the state's economy. Mr. Davis a Democrat and career politician was dealt a bad hand when he took office in 1999. The deregulation plan that sparked the state's electricity crisis was enacted under his predecessor Republican Pete Wilson. But Mr. Davis was slow to react to early signs of trouble this past summer and alarms sounded by members of the state Legislature. By the time Mr. Davis finally sprang into action earlier this year a troublesome power-supply squeeze had escalated into a crisis. In a Jan. 17 declaration of emergency the governor designated the state Department of Water Resources to take the utilities' place as the daily buyer of huge quantities of electricity. His hope: that by making the state the dominant player in California's power sector he would ease electricity producers' concerns about getting paid and give the state enough clout to negotiate lower long-term power prices. Earlier this week Mr. Davis announced final or tentative agreements with 20 power suppliers to furnish the state with a total of 8900 megawatts for periods of as long as 20 years. But the supply situation remains extremely uncertain for this summer when demand probably will top 45000 megawatts. If the state can secure enough power under contract and push down demand through aggressive conservation it might be able to squeak through the summer season. If not it will be forced to keep buying huge amounts of costly power in the cash market. Under deregulation retail electric rates were frozen for several years while wholesale-power costs were free to fluctuate. When the plan was conceived wholesale prices were low and expected to go lower. However a combination of unexpected growth in power demand and a lack of new generating capacity helped produce a supply squeeze. Average wholesale prices more than tripled last year from 1999. And in January those prices were up 10-fold from a year earlier. By then California's two biggest investor-owned utilities -- the Pacific Gas & Electric unit of PG&E Corp. and the Southern California Edison subsidiary of Edison International -- faced imminent financial collapse. They had racked up billions of dollars in wholesale power bills they couldn't afford to pay. As generators began shying away from selling to the two utilities the Clinton administration forced them to sell power into the California market an order left in place during the first weeks of the Bush administration. Still northern California was hit by rolling blackouts on several days in early January. Since then the DWR which does some electricity trading as an adjunct to its main mission of managing the state's giant system of aqueducts and reservoirs has had to learn the ins and outs of power markets on the run. It hasn't been easy. David Mills trading-floor manager for the federal Bonneville Power Administration says the water agency has at times offered to pay $50 to $100 per megawatt hour more than the available market price. They agree to prices that make you wonder says Mr. Mills whose organization markets electricity from federal dams in the Pacific Northwest. You'd at least think they'd check to see what the prevailing price is before throwing out their offer. Mr. Mills says that to cut California some slack he occasionally has instructed his traders to sell at prices lower than the DWR had offered to pay. Ray Hart the water agency deputy director responsible for the power purchasing says he isn't aware of any cases in which the DWR has overpaid. He says his team has been extremely successful by all measures. Ultimately the DWR's trading acumen is far less important than the overall arithmetic of power supply and demand in California. With the price of natural gas that feeds many of the region's generating plants at near record levels and some suppliers reluctant to sell into the troubled California market wholesale electric prices remain stubbornly high and in recent days have again been rising. The Legislature has advanced the DWR about $3 billion from the state's general fund for power purchases. Under emergency legislation passed by the Legislature and signed by Mr. Davis on Feb. 1 the general fund is to be reimbursed from a planned bond sale later this year. But under terms of the emergency law the water agency would have to wrest $2.5 billion a year in revenue from retail electricity rates in order to sell the $10 billion worth of bonds sought by Mr. Davis. Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg a Southern California Democrat says the formula was created to ensure that there would be a way to repay the bonds without draining the state's coffers. We didn't want to just open our wallets he says. According to the language of the Feb. 1 law the water agency gets what's left of revenue collected from ratepayers after the utilities pay certain of their own power-supply bills and other expenses. And in their filings with the PUC last month the utilities reckoned under their worst-case scenarios that there would be only $241 million available to the DWR this year. State officials are quietly pushing the PUC to rejigger the formula so that the water department gets more money -- even though that would clash with terms of the Feb. 1 law. Robert Miyashiro deputy director of the Department of Finance says the emergency law was drafted poorly and has led people to believe the DWR only gets the leftover money. He predicts there will be cleanup legislation. At the request of the Davis administration the PUC is considering a plan to use a different revenue-sharing formula than the one in the state law. The proposed new formula was written in close consultation with Mr. Davis's Finance Department says PUC President Loretta Lynch who supports the initiative and is hoping to rush it through. The effort has drawn some opposition. Commissioner Richard Bilas at a recent PUC meeting questioned the legality of the commission attempting to change a formula set by the Legislature. PG&E is even more emphatic since the DWR's extra money could come at the utility's expense. The formula threatens to undo the very financial protections for the utilities that [the new law] attempted to provide the utility said in a recent filing with the PUC. As politicians and regulators wrestle with that issue the Davis administration has taken a step to reduce the outflow of state cash that also seems to conflict with the Feb. 1 law. It was widely assumed that the law required the DWR to buy any electricity the state needed to keep its lights on. However on many occasions the DWR has refused to buy power on the grounds that it was too expensive citing a portion of the new law that urges the agency to hold down costs. The task of covering any remaining shortfall has passed to the California Independent System Operator which manages the state's energy grid and is charged with buying power when necessary to avert shortages. However the ISO doesn't have any power-purchasing money of its own and the major parties it would normally bill are PG&E and Edison whose inability to pay their power bills was the reason the state started buying electricity in the first place. Amid criticism of its stance from generators utilities and Wall Street the DWR says it has started covering more of the utilities' electricity costs. The water agency is now buying 95% to 99% of what California needs in a given day says the agency's Mr. Hart. But increased buying only adds to the uncertainty about the eventual tab. The state's legislative analyst Elizabeth Hill recently recommended that lawmakers hold off considering more than $2 billion in state spending on items ranging from college construction to beach cleanups because of continuing questions about the financial impact of the electricity crisis. Like others Ms. Hill complains that the governor's office and state agencies haven't been forthcoming with information. Indeed the DWR refuses to say precisely how much power it is purchasing and at what prices though it has on several occasions gone back to the Legislature for more money. State officials say that data on its purchasing activities would give suppliers an advantage in continuing electricity-supply contract talks. State Controller Kathleen Connell who is running for mayor of Los Angeles in an April election recently announced plans to post state power-spending information on her department's Web site. But within 24 hours Ms. Connell suspended that plan after discussions with senior Davis administration officials. I feel very strongly that this information should be publicly released says Ms. Connell. I just don't want to do anything that would weaken the state's effectiveness in negotiating. In an effort to more tightly control events the governor obtained legislative approval to abolish the 26-member ISO board which was made up of everyone from utility executives to representatives of consumer groups. He then appointed a new five-member board. To ensure a quick transition the California attorney general threatened the old board members with fines of as much as $5000 each if they didn't immediately relinquish their positions. All did. I was offended at the heavy-handed treatment says Karen Johanson a former ISO board member. One of the first acts of the ISO's new board was to close a meeting about the electricity crisis. The former ISO board routinely held such meetings in public. ISO attorneys say the meeting was largely designed as a private briefing for new board members and that the organization is committed to keeping its deliberations as open as possible. The Wall Street Journal and other news organizations have unsuccessfully challenged the closure in Sacramento state court. Copyright  2000 Dow Jones & Company Inc.

If we sell to an Indian company then the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) must approve taking dollars out of India. If a sale is made outside India no Indian approvals are necessary.

Everyone is getting into the act. When I started this gig I was the only guy in town writing to folks like you about the power industry in California. I wrote about what?s new what?s happening and all the important stuff. This week Governor Gray Davis decided to write his own Burrito. His epistle got more press than mine but why is he muscling in on my turf? Not to be outdone PUC President Loretta Lynch released a report which looks into every facet of California?s power business. No stone left unturned. I?m telling you there isn?t enough room in this business for all of us. They need to clear out. With people like Herr (Hair?) Peace Governor I?m-Not Mr.-Rogers Davis and Let?s Do Lynch who needs a Friday Burrito? They re-define our reality each week with mind-numbing aplomb. For example starting in early June the PX was ordered to compete for business against other Qualified Trading Vehicles. Then two weeks later the Energy F_hrer legislated that idea to an early death which kept the status quo for at least one year. This week the PUC approved 5-year bilateral deals for PG&E and SCE thereby opening the PX to competition and emasculating the PX?s Block Forward Market. Zip bam boom. I can?t wait to see what next week will bring. I hear Senator Bowen is holding Committee hearings on re regulating the industry and the Governor?s new Energy Security Council will meet to decide six things: What?s for lunch? Who will sit at the head of the table? Does anyone have good seats for next week?s Democratic convention? Is there anyone we haven?t indicted yet in the power industry? Who will crank up the air conditioning in this room? It?s getting too warm. Then they will collect data from innocent businesses under subpoena ignore the facts and publish a report. It makes one want to take a deep breath and inhale the scented fumes of democracy. You know I can?t think about where to begin so let?s start somewhere. >>> Things on the Island of California @@@ Is there anyone left at SDG&E with a brain? @@@ The PUC issues its scathing report @@@ The ISO invokes $250 price caps. Duh! >>> Things at the throne of FERC @@@ Amen for the Morgan Stanley Order >>> Odds and Ends (_!_) >>> Things on the Island of California @@@ Is there anyone left at SDG&E with a brain? Well the answer very clearly is no. I have been astounded by repeated attempts of SDG&E?s most senior people to ape humans but instead they mimic apes. Consider the following. First they waltz their default customers into the summer with little of no protection from price spikes in the wholesale market. Forgivable in that it is human to err. The prices skyrocket in June and they start looking for who to blame. _Must be them damn independent generatorsO say their managers. Gary Cotton informs the ISO Governing Board that hedging SDG&E?s position in the Block Forward Market wouldn?t have made any difference. There?s one nobel laureate who missed his prime. Next under pressure they ask for help from suppliers and anyone else who will assist the utility and their customers. Nine offers show up at their table and they can?t choose any of them. Again Mr Cotton tells his fellow ISO Governing Board members that these things take time and we don?t to rush since there are many legislative barriers and well the surfing was good this week so why spoil it? Now they are in a panic because the Energy F_hrer is visiting old ladies living in trailer parks advising them not to pay their SDG&E electricity bill and to continue to operate their air conditioners. SDG&E puts a full page ad in the local newspaper telling everyone that SDG&E is doing everything it can to lower their electric bills including asking the ISO for a $250 price cap but the public can help by calling the ISO [address and phone number provided in the ad] and urging them to lower the cap. I always thought the location of the ISO was a State secret for security reasons. No secrets in San Diego. But we are not done. No sir we are not. Those buffalo heads who run that company decide they will win a gold star on their collective foreheads and implement one of the four resolutions passed by the Electric Oversight Board. The one they pick is to petition FERC on an expedited basis to cap at $250 the price at which sellers may bid energy or ancillary services into the ISO and the PX. The primary reason is that Western power markets are not workably competitive. In other words they want FERC to set a max price on what generators can sell in addition to the price limit at which the ISO can buy! What I find most astounding about this double talk is that SDG&E continues to collect tons of money from the sales of regulatory must run energy into the PX. These are sales from their stranded assets. Their grief hasn?t abated their greed. So to recap SDG&E missed the boat on price hedging failed to win consumer confidence in public meetings asked for help from suppliers and did nothing in response then filed at FERC to cap the sale price because the wholesale market into which they sell (over-priced?) energy is not workably competitive. Too much time in the direct sun light. >>> Things on the Island of California @@@ The PUC issues its scathing report The PUC report released yesterday is a gem with which I have not spent enough time. I only read the Executive Summary and that only because our counsel Dan Douglass forwarded me a copy. Let me pick out some of the gems in President Lets Do Lynch?s burrito. I would recommend reading the whole text if you have time and if you seek perverse entertainment. _California is experiencing major problems with electricity supply and pricing caused by policies and procedures adopted over the past ten years. _ Since June wholesale prices for electrical power in California have increased on average 270% over the same period in 1999 resulting in over $1 billion in excess payments for electricity. _Hot weather aging power plant and transmission infrastructure and dysfunctional bidding behavior in the wholesale power markets combined to drive prices up ... _Because of serious market defects and tight supply of electricity purchasers of California power will likely pay billions more in electricity costs this year. Moreover these price increases do not necessarily fund new investments in electricity supply or delivery reliability - they may flow solely to power producer profit margins. _Despite the Electricity Oversight Board's legislative mandate to oversee those institutions we have been unable to obtain [bid] data. Nevertheless ...  we believe enough evidence of questionable behavior exists that the Attorney General should conduct an investigation into these statewide market practices coordinating with other State agencies including the PUC and the EOB. Such an investigation would provide the factual foundation that California policy makers and regulators need to recover any illegally obtained profits. _A momentous consequence of California's attempt to create a market in electricity is that the federal government now regulates California's electric system. Washington D.C. now controls pricing decisions directly at the wholesale level and indirectly at the retail level and to the extent that supply incentives are correlated to prices Washington D.C. now affects California's ability to attract new investment in power plants. _Past administrations' willingness to cede the State's authority to the federal government combined with the legislative creation of two non-public supervisory organizations that have no duty to protect the public or consider the retail customer. The Independent System Operator (ISO) and the Power Exchange (PX) the nonprofit private corporations that operate the State's transmission system and control wholesale pricing policies are governed by boards whose members can have serious conflicts of interest. Some of these board members or their companies financially benefit from higher prices in electricity markets. Neither of these private organizations is accountable to the State or its consumers .... _Despite the federalization and the fragmentation of the State's electric services the State of California should protect its businesses and consumers from cartel pricing collusive behavior inadequate power plant maintenance and lack of market planning for adequate electricity supplies. _California consumers and businesses deserve to know in advance - as San Diegans did not this summer - how and when the price of an essential service like electricity will double. California is now largely constrained by federal mandates from providing comprehensive retail price relief as long as wholesale prices remain so high. If California tried to re-impose a price freeze in San Diego now federal regulators would likely prevent that action. ...

The Democrats in Sacramento are doing that for me. Welcome comrade. >>> Things on the Island of California @@@ The ISO invokes $250 price caps. Duh! It is really hard to describe the drama of an ISO Governing Board meeting especially when our favorite topic arises. It seems the only time the Board becomes animated is when one of three issues are on the agenda: price caps FTRs and priorities for software enhancements. Otherwise its pretty much hum-drum. %Round and %round we went once again. A few more forced votes tipped the scale in favor of the cap. There were 15 yes votes which included a forced yes vote from our friend Jerry Toenyes by order of Secretary of Energy Mr. Richardson. [Jerry did you realize that the last letters of your name could be re-arranged to spell _NO ET YESO? Kind of a french thing.] I?m sorry about that vote Jerry. You still go in my book as one of the brave and bold for standing up to that sort of intimidation for so long. Your picture in the SF Chron said it all. The brave souls who stood tall and voted NO included David Parquet (Enron) Jan Smutny-Jones (IEP) Barbara Barkovich (CLECA) Caolyn Kehrein (CMA) Dan Kirshner (EDF) and Stacy Roscoe (Procter & Gamble). Now I must admit that Dynegy?s Greg Blue did help by voting a Texas No spelled _A-B-S-T-A-I-NO. I have instructed Dynegy trader Dave Francis in Houston to work with Greg to correct that problem. We?re going to work things out. The Energy F_hrer addressed the Board again. I didn?t mind that I only had a few brief very brief moments to address the Board and Herr (Hair?) Peace got over 20 minutes. That didn?t bother me at all. He did more damage to himself in 20 than I could do in 2. He blasted away at everyone who opposed him. He pined about Camden quitting the Board. He said he knew how prices and markets work that it isn?t the way those academic egg-head FERC-loving economists tell you who pray to the gods of competition. He lambasted WAPA for withholding generation to protect fish and wildlife (what was that all about?). He predicted that on Thursday?s PUC meeting he and all the other powerful Democrats Republicans and angry citizens of San Diego would demand that the PUC impose a rate cap on retail electric rates in San Diego that are just and reasonable (it didn?t happen). And on and on and on. This man is very delusional. He believes that Steve and only Steve Peace can save the world. He believes that political will trumps judicial quasi-judicial or independent Board actions. This man makes relevant all the abstract musings of the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche (1844-1900) ... The will to power the ?bermensch the transvaluation of values etc. But we are getting under (uber?) his skin with the help of the press. Wednesday afternoon I called Commissioner Dick Bilas to see if he thought whether the next day?s PUC meeting was going to be a roll over. Dick said he got a call from Peace and that Peace said he would not come to the meeting. Apparently Peace had received a lot of press and all of it bad. That?s the thin line of freedom which keeps tyranny at least one step away from our front door. >>> Things at the throne of FERC @@@ Amen for the Morgan Stanley Order And now the good news. You deserve this. FERC gave the California market a little wiggle room last Friday. FERC issued a last minute reply to the complaint by Morgan Stanley Capital Group relating to the ISO?s intent to lower the price cap. FERC denied the complaint but they didn?t waste time with an Order to simply deny a complaint. FERC danced on the head of the ISO and pulled the bite out of the price cap. Here are some excerpts: _We accepted this [Amendment 21] not because it was a cap on sellers? prices but because it would promote order and transparency in the market by clearly telling sellers of the maximum price the ISO was willing to pay and allowing sellers to make informed economic choices on whether to sell in the ISO market or to sell elsewhere... _ ... The ISO has no more or less ability to procure capacity and energy than any other buyer of these services ... If the ISO is unable to elicit sufficient supplies at or below its announced purchase price ceiling (because generators are free to sell elsewhere if they choose) it will have to raise its purchase price to the level necessary to meet its needs. ... Therefore an increase in out-of-market (OOM) calls for generation may be necessary to maintain system reliability. Because the current payment for OOM is not subject to a maximum purchase price the resulting overall payments may be higher. _To the extent the ... ISO Board resolution contemplates implementing a directive that generators must bid their capacity into the ISO markets under any circumstances (e.g. when system load exceeds 38000 MW) such a requirement is not permitted by our ... Order and the ISO tariff. ... Future implementation of the ISO Board resolution with regard to a requirement to sell would require significant revisions to the ISO market rules. Such market changes could not become effective absent a corresponding amendment to the ISO tariff which would have to be filed under section 205 of the FPA.O Well. What do you think about that? Just wait. Here is what the sleeping bear Commissioner Hebert said in his concurring remarks: _Getting to the bottom of the problem in my view requires us to begin a proceeding to rescind our approval of the ISO as the operator of the California grid. The record supports such a move. ... A memorandum to the ISO from a stakeholder who resigned from the governing board eloquently brings to our attention repeated attempts to undermine the independence of the ISO. The memorandum also thoughtfully outlines consequences to the markets of a return to %command and control.? _Because these allegations come from a non-market participant especially should we take heed. We must also take notice of the public pressure on the Board to compromise its independence.O Amen brother amen. >>> Odds and Ends (_!_) As you can imagine this week like an endless string of weeks before this has been interminable. I get about three phone calls a day from press reporters very little of which ever sees print. My shtick is just too complex for casual readers. But I do notice that the reporters are asking better questions. The public is becoming more savvy. The information flow is moving in our favor and will disarm the forces of evil in about 10 years. I have other problems on my mind. I am working on a new computer system. Really it?s just an upgrade of an older computer that is a bit faster than the laptop I tried to upgrade very unsuccessfully. As a result of the all the new hardware and software I purchased my office looks like a war zone with an odd mix of PUC service copies computer documentation and diskettes laying all around. Quite a mess. Prepare for the future. Our next general meeting is scheduled for Thursday and Friday October 5 and 6 at Moro Bay. Barb Ennis will prepare a blurb for us in next week?s Burrito about room reservations timing golf etc. Our guest speakers will include MSC Chairman Professor Frank Wolak who will talk on the subject of his choice Ms. Irene Moosen of Grueneich Resource Advocates who will make a presentation on the distributed generation case before the PUC and William Freddo of PG&E National Energy Group who will give us some education on operating a power plant inside the New England ISO. Now for your daily bread provided this week by Dan Douglass. Last week we had a joke about Catholics. This week it?s agnostics. ===================== An atheist was taking a walk thru the woods admiring all that the accident of evolution had created. What majestic trees! What powerful rivers! What beautiful animals! he said to himself. As he was walking alongside the river he heard a rustling in the bushes behind him. As he turned to look he saw a 7 foot grizzly bear charging towards him. He ran as fast as he could up the path. He looked over his shoulder and saw that the bear was closing in on him. He tried to run even faster so scared that tears were coming to his eyes. His heart was pumping frantically as he tried to run even faster but he tripped and fell on the ground. He rolled over to pick himself up and saw the bear right on top of him raising its paw to kill him. At that instant he cried out Oh my God! And time stopped. The bear froze. The forest was silent. The river even stopped flowing. A bright light shone upon the man and a voice out of the sky said You deny my existence all these years teach others I don't exist and even credit my creation to a cosmic accident and now do you expect me to help you out of this predicament? Am I to count you as a believer? The atheist ever so proud looked into the light and said It would be rather hypocritical to ask to be counted as a believer after all these years but could you make the bear a believer? Very well said the voice. And the light went out the river flowed the sounds of the forest continued and the bear brought both paws together bowed his head and said Lord I thank you for this food which I am about to receive. ================== Amen. And have a great weekend. Oh and thanks to all of you who sent me happy birthday wishes. It was very much appreciated. KSB gba - att1.htm,"California Power Industry; Politics; Email

467,Re: Follow Up On California Information,Alan and I spoke about point #2 on the comparison benchmark. At this point we may be able to just say it is based on a comparison of the contracts with today's forward market and gloss over the exact forward curve we used. Of course if there is a way to come up with a similar number using publicly available data (or if we are willing to provide our numbers if pressed) then all the better. In the mean time should I hold off on using the $13.8 billion number until I hear back from you about the conversation with Steve? Also do I understand correctly from Alan that the $13.8 billion figure is NOT comparing the long term contracts California signed with recent spot market prices but rather is a comparison of the contracts to our present forward pricing curves? From you e-mail it is the latter I take it. As to point #1 on the deal last year we just need a similar back of the envelope calculation on what California could have saved had California taken us up on the offers we and others made.

LOS ANGELES -- In the latest attempt to fix California's troubled deregulated energy market officials adopted a unique variable-pricing plan that already is being criticized by power generators and traders as unworkable and praised by utilities and consumers as much needed protection against gouging. Under the plan adopted late last week by the governing board of the California Independent System Operator or ISO a quasipublic agency responsible for maintaining electricity reliability in the state the cap on wholesale power will be reset hourly from about $65 per megawatt hour at low-demand times to no more than $250 an hour at periods of high demand. It was the third time this year that officials effectively lowered the price cap on wholesale electricity in a bid to contain -- so far unsuccessfully -- soaring total power costs. The move underscores the chaotic atmosphere prevailing in California's power market after a two-year-old experiment in deregulation has come undone. In other deregulated markets such as New York and New England prices are capped at $1000 per megawatt hour which are intended to be low enough to prevent market abuse but high enough to give generators incentive to build new plants. California's system was supposed to work the same way. But because utilities in California divested themselves of the bulk of their plants but weren't allowed to lock in fixed-price supply contracts unlike in the other markets merchant generators have had much greater sway over prices here on the spot market where most power trades. During the first nine months of the year the average price of wholesale electricity was $90 per megawatt hour in California triple the price of a year earlier. Even on cool days in October the price generally has remained above $100 per megawatt hour. California utilities have lost money on those power purchases because their customers' rates are frozen at $54 to $65 per megawatt hour far lower than the average price utilities have had to pay for that power. The deficits exceeded $5 billion in the June-to-September period. California utilities buy the power used by their customers from the state-sanctioned auctions administered by the ISO and a sister organization the California Power Exchange. In New York and New England by comparison less than 20% of power is purchased from the spot markets because utilities there were able to sign the fixed-price contracts which California utilities weren't allowed to do. The price-cap decision passed last week by a vote of 13 to 10 primarily with support from utilities and board members representing consumer interests. It was pushed aggressively by Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Southern California Edison the state's two big investor-owned utilities that have gotten caught in the price-spike vise this year. Some ISO members say they had no choice but to support the measure to ratchet down price caps. We're going after the windfall profits said S. David Freeman general manager of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power who voted for the measure. What we've got now is a market accustomed to ripping off the consumer. This can't be allowed to go on. But other experts said the hasty measure may make California's problems even worse. The short-term regulatory fix is always to fix prices said Pam Prairie director of the Institute of Public Utilities at Michigan State University in East Lansing. But there's a real danger you'll set prices too low and make your supply problems even worse. Other economists agreed. At best this is poorly administered cost-based regulation said Frank Wolak an economics professor at Stanford University who sits on an independent market-monitoring committee at the ISO. At worst it creates all sorts of perverse market incentives. For example it may increase the problem of megawatt laundering on hot days in which in-state generators sell power to out-of-state customers who then sell it back into the state effectively bypassing the cap. Likewise it could encourage generators to build new plants outside of California rather than where they are needed near its major cities also to avoid the cap. In the end it could increase stresses to the state's already overburdened transmission system. In fact the decision already has brought to a halt the state's forward electricity market which allows wholesale customers to sign contracts for power they will use in the future. The market had been trading as much as 1000 contracts a week. On Friday there was practically no activity. This decision shows the height of lunacy said Rick Shapiro a managing director at Enron Corp. the giant Houston-based energy trader. Mr. Shapiro said Enron and other generators will file appeals at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission asking that the new pricing formula be rescinded. It is possible the FERC may throw out the pricing formula anyway. It is expected to issue a major order on Nov. 1 directing changes in California's market structure. That order will include its determination of the effectiveness of price caps. It also is expected to judge the merits of the governance structure at the ISO which has lately been marked by infighting. Recently consumer groups have charged that the ISO board has put the business interests of its members ahead of members' fiduciary duty to California residents. The most recent price-cap measure was approved over the objections of executives at the ISO whose job it will be to implement the formula. ISO Chief Executive Terry Winter said the measure is flawed because it doesn't take into account the amount of power available to the California market. Mr. Winter fears the caps will place the state at a disadvantage relative to neighboring states with no price caps. About 11 states are electrically interconnected in the West meaning power can be moved between them and chase the highest prices. We keep getting accused of making our market too complicated Mr. Winter said. Then along comes this proposal with caps that would adjust repeatedly throughout the day depending on demand.

Enron Offers Cash To Help Azurix Take Itself Private By Rebecca Smith Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal 10/30/2000 The Wall Street Journal A12 (Copyright (c) 2000 Dow Jones & Company Inc.) Enron Corp. offered to lend Azurix Corp. an Enron spinoff $275 million so that it could take itself private. Enron which has been frustrated with the global water company's performance suggested Friday that public shareholders receive a cash offer of $7 a share for their Azurix stock. While nearly double the stock's value prior to the offer the suggested price nevertheless was far below the $19 at which Azurix made its debut in 1999. An Azurix spokeswoman said the board on which Enron has seats had not yet decided how to treat the Enron offer. An Enron spokesman said that taking the company private would give us more opportunity to directly affect our investment. In 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday Azurix soared $3 to $6.56 in heavy trading. Azurix had hoped to create a splash by doing to the water business what Enron had done to the energy business -- increase competition and provide trading skills capable of creating new financial products out of old commodities. But Azurix stumbled nearly from the outset. Deregulation of the water business and government privatizations of water systems on which it was counting were slow to come crimping growth opportunities and profit. And Enron accustomed to higher faster returns grew impatient with the capital-intensive water business. The company's first chief executive Rebecca Mark a onetime head of Enron's international division resigned in the summer with the agreement of Enron executives who said it was time for new leadership. The incoming chief executive John Garrison said he would look for buyers for some of the company's businesses he was unavailable to comment Friday. Ms. Mark was believed to be considering making an offer for some of those businesses herself. She declined a request for an interview. In its letter to Azurix officers Enron said the water company received four offers from prospective suitors after Ms. Mark's departure the best of which came from an unidentified bidder who offered $7 a share and went through a lengthy due-diligence process before backing down apparently spooked by Azurix's cash flow capital structure tax considerations and some securities litigation. In its proposal letter made public Friday Enron said it concluded that there is no other buyer willing to pay the $7 and so proceeded with its own offer. But Enron said it won't try to limit Azurix's ability to negotiate a better deal with others should they come forward. Finally Enron noted that Azurix had considered various partial or full-liquidation alternatives but said they didn't seem likely to produce more than $7 a share.

Enron Offers Loan to Azurix Enron Corp. offered to lend Azurix Corp. an Enron spinoff $275 million (327.6 million euros) so that it could take itself private.

Business Wessex switch likely Adam Jones in New York 10/28/2000 The Times of London News International 2W 64 (Copyright Times Newspapers Ltd 2000) Wessex Water's American parent company is likely to be taken private after a disastrous 14-month spell as a quoted company. Wessex which provides water services to the South of England was bought by Azurix in 1998 for Pounds 1.6 billion. Azurix wanted to use Wessex's expertise in privatised water supply to build a global business. However since listing at $19 a share in June last year Azurix stock has gone into freefall closing at less than $4 earlier this week. Azurix slumped because it drastically misjudged the number of privatisation opportunities. It emerged last night that Enron the Texan energy and trading company that is Azurix's biggest shareholder has taken the unusual step of offering to lend Azurix $275 million (Pounds 190 million) to buy its publicly held shares thereby taking it private. The Enron proposal would value Azurix at about $800 million or $7 per share - 63 per cent less than the IPO price. Enron would control Azurix and Wessex Water if it went private. Copyright  2000 Dow Jones & Company Inc. All Rights Reserved. BUSINESS Enron water unit could go private under loan plan NELSON ANTOSH Staff 10/28/2000 Houston Chronicle 3 STAR 1 (Copyright 2000) Enron offered Friday to lend Azurix its struggling water affiliate about $275 million so Azurix can go private by purchasing 38.6 million shares that are publicly traded. The deal would have Azurix buying back its stock at $7 per share about double what the shares were trading for Thursday. That's a big comedown for Azurix shares which sold for $19 each when the Houston company went public in June 1999. The maneuver technically can be called a take-under said analyst Carol Coale of Prudential Securities in Houston. She also described it as Enron's least painful solution for what to do with the venture that never lived up its ambitious plans. Nothing about Azurix has been positive for Enron in my view said Coale. This is a solution to a problem. Azurix spokeswoman Diane Bazelides said its board is studying Enron's proposal. She added that it was too early to comment on the offer because the proposal's structure had not been outlined. Enron imposed no deadline for a decision by Azurix but reserved the right to withdraw the offer if Azurix's position with prospective customers and employees deteriorated. One of Enron's conditions is that Azurix not sell any major assets before the buyout. The deal would not change Enron's large stake in Azurix said Palmer. It owns a third while the other third is owned by the Atlantic Water Trust in which Enron owns a 50 percent voting interest. The proposal's advantages include giving public shareholders a premium to the market price said Enron spokesman Mark Palmer. The common stock of Azurix zoomed Friday on the news gaining $3 to close at $6.56 on the New York Stock Exchange. Becoming a private company would give Azurix management greater flexibility in restructuring. Coale said it would reduce Azurix's general and administrative costs helping it to bid against lower- cost foreign competition particularly two big French companies. Azurix's high cost structure has been its primary problem she said. Azurix has been looking at cost and strategies ever since it got a new president and chief executive on Aug. 25 said Bazelides. That was the date that Rebecca Mark resigned as Azurix's high-profile chairman and chief executive. Enron and Azurix have been looking at strategic alternatives for nine months J. Mark Meets Enron's executive vice president for corporate development said in a letter filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. One alternative was selling the company he said. That didn't work out because the offers from three companies didn't exceed $4 per share. The fourth potential buyer said it would consider offering $7 per share said Meets. But that suitor backed out citing reasons like cash flow complexity of the capital structure tax considerations and pending securities litigation. We are obviously quite disappointed by this most recent turn of events Meets said in the letter. However we strongly believe that there is no other buyer willing to pay the $7 per share initially proposed (but later withdrawn) by the fourth bidder. Copyright  2000 Dow Jones & Company Inc.

Ken Herman American-Statesman Capitol Bureau Chief 10/28/2000 Austin American-Statesman A1 (Copyright 2000) Not long ago at a glossy wooden table in a Texas Capitol office two of Gov. George W. Bush's high-level appointees discussed one of the key issues in state government these days. It involved the relative merits of White House posts that could be available to the two appointees if Bush becomes president. Asked this week whether it's a common topic around the Capitol one of the appointees gestured to the anteroom of his office and made a motion indicating that even the midlevel folks have Washington on their minds. Near the banks of the Colorado Potomac Fever is a near-epidemic. And though it is political faux pas to be too open about doing White House transition planning before Election Day be assured it is going on at Bush headquarters where top officials are cognizant of the fine line between looking too confident now and looking too unprepared later. The candidate himself -- as well as his top aides -- steers clear of transition talk. When asked who might wind up in his Cabinet Bush looks backward instead of forward saying that his selection of Dick Cheney as his running mate should offer a glimpse of the kind of people who would wind up in his administration. The transition work such that it is is under the aegis of longtime Bush friend and aide Clay Johnson who began as head of the gubernatorial appointments office and now serves as chief of staff. Johnson said nobody has been interviewed for any Washington post but he has compiled a file of folks who are interested in serving in a Bush administration. Johnson also has been reading up on previous transitions -- ones that went well and ones that didn't. His preliminary conclusion is that the outgoing administrations are generally helpful and supportive even if they were ousted by the incoming administration. It's the incoming administrations that can make the mistakes he said. There is no shortage of think tanks that have think-tanked the topic. Back in August the Heritage Foundation based in Washington issued a transition handbook titled The Keys to a Successful Presidency. Though we really don't expect either campaign to talk about it (and would discourage them from doing so) the message here is it's time to start planning for a possible presidential transition quietly well behind the scenes but with the understanding that the preparation done during the next 70 or so days and the work done in the 70 or so days that follow (between the election and the inauguration) will very well determine the initial success or failure of the next administration Herbert Berkowitz a foundation vice president said in releasing the study. All indications are that the Bush team has been following the advice with Johnson at the helm. Johnson cautions against expectations that a Bush administration would be overloaded with Texans. It's the United States of America not the United States of Texas he said. Despite that caveat there is no shortage of Texans who are considered shoo-ins to fill some of the thousands of slots Bush could offer if he wins. Johnson confirms that he is very interested in a Washington job. Early speculation among Bush aides makes Johnson a potential leading contender for head of personnel at the White House. Karen Hughes Bush's communications director since his 1994 gubernatorial campaign is expected to become Bush's press secretary if he wins the White House. Karl Rove Bush's longtime political guru also will be on board though he could wind up with an out-of- the-White-House post perhaps at the Republican National Committee. Not as certain is the potential future for Joe Allbaugh who is part of the iron triangle of top advisers -- along with Rove and Hughes -- who have been on board with Bush since the 1994 campaign. Allbaugh serves as manager of the presidential campaign and previously served as chief of staff in the governor's office. Capitol speculation indicates Allbaugh could decide to skip a White House post possibly in favor of a lobbying job if he is not tapped as chief of staff. That post could go to Don Evans a longtime Bush friend who headed the megasuccessful fund-raising effort for the presidential campaign. However not everyone has Potomac Fever. For example Terral Smith Bush's legislative director said he will stay in Austin to lobby. In addition to the speculation about appointees the approaching election has sparked talk about when Bush might leave office if he wins. Under the U.S. Constitution he could remain governor until he has to become president on Jan. 20. Much more likely however is that Bush would leave office sooner than that perhaps as soon as two or three weeks after the Nov. 7 election if he wins. That could cause a housing problem for Bush whose main residence is the Governor's Mansion which comes as a free perk of the job. The Bushes have a home under construction at their ranch in Crawford near Waco. The ranch also has a smaller house in which the Bushes now spend weekends. Not out of the question is that Bush could work out an arrangement with Lt. Gov. Rick Perry who would become governor if Bush resigns to remain in the Governor's Mansion for several weeks after he leaves office. If the race among Texas senators to replace Perry as lieutenant governor complicates the timing of the resignation Bush could stay in the governor's office a little longer but no later than the first week of January. After all he will want to give Perry time to bask in his gubernatorial inauguration before the Legislature convenes Jan. 9. No matter when Bush resigns confidantes believe he might use his Crawford ranch for interviews with potential top-level appointees including Cabinet members.

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- A Dynegy executive said Friday that the California Independent System Operator's plan to impose hourly price caps on the wholesale power market will compromise reliability by forcing generators to sell electricity out of state. If the ISO says it will not buy above a certain price and generators cannot operate below that price then we have no choice but to find other markets to participate in said Dynegy senior vice president of marketing and trading asset management Lynn Lednicky. That may lead to the ISO not finding the power it needs at a price it wants to pay. The ISO plans to construct hourly price caps each month based on forecast load natural gas prices and generation unit efficiency. The caps will take effect Nov. 3 or soon therafter. Dynegy Inc. (DYN) sent a letter to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission asking it to address reliability consequences of the price caps before Nov. 3. Dynegy specifically requested that FERC discuss the issue at its Nov. 1 meeting when it will release a report on California's electricity problems. Enron Corp. (ENE) and Southern Company (SO) share Dynegy's concerns about reliability and plan to petition FERC about the issue said a trader listening in to a conference call between the three companies. -By Jessica Berthold Dow Jones Newswires 323-658-3872 jessica.berthold@dowjones.com Copyright  2000 Dow Jones & Company Inc.

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES New York -(Dow Jones)- Shares of Azurix Corp. (AZX) jumped 84% in heavy trading Friday after parent Enron Corp. (ENE) proposed to take the company private in a $7-a-share buyout. Filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission showed that Enron made the proposal after not being satisfied with offers it had received from four third parties for its stake in Azurix. In a letter to two members of Azurix's board Enron said three potential buyers were unlikely to be willing to pay more than the then-current market price of approximately $4 a share. Enron said a fourth potential buyer indicated it would consider a $7-a-share offer but it said that proposal was recently withdrawn. The reasons given by the bidder included pro forma cash flows the complexity of the capital structure tax considerations and the currently pending securities litigation the letter said. Mark Palmer a spokesman for Houston-based Enron declined to say whether Enron was entertaining current third-party interests or was in any talks with other parties regarding its Azurix stake. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Azurix ended Friday up $3 to $6.56 on 2.8 million shares compared with average daily volume of 239000 shares. Enron was up $1.38 or 1.8% to $78.88 on 1.6 million shares compared with its daily average turnover of 2.4 million. In the SEC filing Enron saying it's familiar with Azurix's various partial and full liquidation alternatives said its buyout proposal is conditioned upon Azurix not selling any significant assets prior to the buyout. Although we agree that such plans may result in greater value to Azurix's shareholders than the maintenance of the status quo we believe that these options almost certainly will not result on a present value in a greater return to Azurix's shareholders than $7 a share the letter said. Enron also said its buyout proposal doesn't include any breakup fees or other deal protection devices. This frees Azurix's board to pursue an acquisition that might provide greater value to shareholders. Daine Bazelides a spokeswoman for Azurix declined to say whether Azurix is now entertaining offers for the company. She did however confirm the information contained in Enron's filing. The historical information in the filing is factually correct she told Dow Jones Newswires. She said she doesn't know when Azurix board will respond to Enron's proposal. In the filing Enron didn't set a deadline but warned that Azurix's position with customers and employees may deteriorate further. We must therefore reserve the right to withdraw our proposal at any time Enron's letter said. In the letter Enron pointed out that Azurix had retained two internationally recognized investment bankers early this year to evaluate strategic alternatives which included the potential sale of the company to unrelated third parties. Enron said it strongly believes there isn't another buyer willing to pay $7 a share for Enron's indirect interest in Azurix. We believe it is in Azurix's best interest as well as the best interest of its shareholders and employees if Azurix were no longer a publicly traded company Enron said. -By Christopher C.

Enron offers to buy out Azurix Financial Times By Hillary Durgin in Houston Published: October 27 2000 23:31GMT | Last Updated: October 27 2000 23:36GMT Enron the Houston-based energy and trading group said on Friday it had offered up to $275m in funding to take Azurix private at a buy-out price of $7 per share. The specific structure of Enron's proposal has yet to be determined Enron said. Azurix said its board would now consider the proposal. The timing of any decision was unclear. Enron owns directly and indirectly about 66 per cent of Azurix the troubled Houston water company whose main asset is UK-based Wessex Water. The buyout offer is the latest development in a history of problems at Azurix which was spun off from Enron and taken public at an offering price of $19 per share. But a combination of poor market timing competitive industry conditions and empty promises by the company on Wall Street took their toll on the company whose shares have since plummeted and have been trading most recently around the $3-per-share range. In August Rebecca Mark Azurix chief executive officer resigned both from Azurix and from the board at Enron. Enron's offer came after four unnamed parties approached Enron about buying its stake in Azurix. While three of the four were unwilling to pay more than the then market price of about $4 per share a fourth party who was considering offering $7 per share (before accounting for any dilution for stock options) later declined to pursue the transaction Enron said in Friday's letter to Azurix outlining the buyout proposal. We strongly believe that our proposal is fair to Azurix's public stockholders the letter stated. Our proposed transaction would permit Azurix's stockholders to receive on a timely basis a cash payment for their shares that is significantly above the price at which those shares have traded in several months. Analysts that follow Azurix and had valued the shares at between $6 and $8 per shares said the offer was fair. Analysts that follow Enron said that Azurix's business strategy had proved to be a failure and was characteristic of the hard asset approach that Enron has gradually distanced itself from. Enron's shares closed at $78.88 up $1.38 on Friday. Azurix's shares rose $3 to close at $6.56.,"Energy; California; Enron; Wessex Water; Water; Business; Politics

San Jose Mercury News April 19 2001 Thursday KR-ACC-NO: SJ-POWER LENGTH: 593 words HEADLINE: Testimony Indicates California Electricity Market Was Troubled in 1998 BYLINE: By Brandon Bailey BODY: ??SACRAMENTO Calif.--California's electricity market was showing signs of trouble as far back as 1998 the year that it was officially opened to competition members of a special legislative investigating committee were told Wednesday. ??Abnormal price spikes -- far higher than what should have occurred in a competitive market -- were showing up in August 1998 the committee was told by Frank Wolak a Stanford economist and top advisor to the California Independent System Operator which runs the state's transmission grid. ??Appearing on the first day of hearings called by a state Senate select committee to investigate alleged wholesale energy price manipulation Wolak testified that the ISO's economic advisors repeatedly found signs that power suppliers were able to influence prices over the last three years -- even before wholesale prices soared skyhigh last summer. ??By controlling even a relatively small portion of power supply just enough to make a difference in whether the state could meet consumers' needs Wolak said generators have been able to charge prices far higher than their costs. ??All told the ISO has estimated power suppliers collected more than $ 6 billion in unjustified profits last year. ??In his opinion Wolak added that violates the terms by which federal regulators allowed the suppliers to enter the state's newly deregulated market when it opened in 1998. ??The ISO is now filing petitions with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission asking that agency to revoke the generators' right to charge unregulated prices. ??But Wolak repeatedly told the committee that he had no evidence that the suppliers acted in collusion or that they had violated any federal anti-trust laws. ??When state Senator Joe Dunn D-Garden Grove pressed him on the point Wolak insisted I can't say yes I can't say no. There's a lot of things that certainly look puzzling. It's hard without further information and analysis to say definitively but there's lots of things to seem to be worth looking into. ??Dunn a former consumer attorney is leading the Legislature's efforts to answer a question that a host of other state and federal officials have also posed: have California's electricity prices been the result of any illegal or unethical acts? ??Power suppliers and their representatives have repeatedly said the answer is no. They say their prices are the result of short supplies and natural market swings. ??Eleven investigations into California's electricity market have been conducted or are currently under way said a statement issued Wednesday by Jan Smutny-Jones executive director of the Independent Energy Producers Association. Not one has found or proven any wrongdoing by generators. ??Dunn however said Wednesday's testimony was only the start of what he promised would be a vigorous investigation. He said the committee has already asked several power companies for records and other information and he hinted that subpoenas may be issued in the coming weeks. ??We will try to figure out how to stop these high prices if they are unjustified Dunn said at the beginning of the hearing. ??We're not going to be looking for ways to finance these payments he added. The state is now paying $ 70 million a day to buy power for California consumers after major utilities wracked up billions in debts while buying power on the open market in recent months. ??----- ??To see more of the San Jose Mercury News or to subscribe to the newspaper go to http://www.sjmercury.com JOURNAL-CODE: SJ LOAD-DATE: April 19 2001 of 5 DOCUMENTS ???????????????????The Associated Press State & Local Wire The materials in the AP file were compiled by The Associated Press. ?These materials may not be republished without the express written consent of The Associated Press. ??????????????????????April 19 2001 Thursday BC cycle AM Eastern Time SECTION: State and Regional LENGTH: 930 words HEADLINE: Developments in California's energy crisis BYLINE: By The Associated Press BODY: ??Developments in California's energy crisis: ??THURSDAY: ??- The state remains free of power alerts as reserves stay above 7 percent. ??- Gov.

Dynegy agrees to sell 300 megawatts of power from 17 small turbine generators in Carlsbad after receiving an offer from the California Department of Water Resources. ??- Gov.

The bill now goes to the Assembly Appropriations Committee. ??- A Pacific Gas and Electric Corp. shareholder sues the company claiming it misled shareholders by forecasting annual profits for two quarters last year when the suit says the company knew it was incurring losses. ??-Public Utilities Commission President Loretta Lynch issues a statement late Wednesday saying inaction by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission forced Southern Caifornia Edison Co. to take a large write-off of debt.

Davis says he expects to have an agreement within two weeks. ??- The state Public Utilities Commission will decide Thursday whether to investigate why a key block of power generators is staying off-line despite regulators' order last month that they start getting paid by the state's utilities. Independent Energy Producers Executive Director Jan Smutny-Jones says the generators can't afford to operate because they are still owed more than a billion dollars and because the PUC's rates don't cover their operating costs. ??PUC President Loretta Lynch also wants the commission to decide Thursday to investigate whether PG&E's April 6 bankruptcy protection filing is enough of a threat to the PUC's regulatory authority to prompt more PUC involvement in the bankruptcy proceedings. ??THE PROBLEM: ??High demand high wholesale energy costs transmission glitches and a tight supply worsened by scarce hydroelectric power in the Northwest and maintenance at aging California power plants are all factors in California's electricity crisis. ??Edison and PG&E say they've lost nearly $14 billion since June to high wholesale prices that the state's electricity deregulation law bars them from passing on to consumers. PG&E saying it hasn't received the help it needs from regulators or state lawmakers filed for federal bankruptcy protection April 6. ??Electricity and natural gas suppliers scared off by the two companies' poor credit ratings are refusing to sell to them leading the state in January to start buying power for the utilities' nearly 9 million residential and business customers. The state is also buying power for a third investor-owned utility San Diego Gas & Electric which is in better financial shape than much larger Edison and PG&E but also struggling with high wholesale power costs. ??The Public Utilities Commission has raised rates up to 46 percent to help finance the state's multibillion-dollar power-buying.

It's obviously way higher than $100 million. ??Natural gas rates at the California border generally tracked national prices until November when they spiked as high as 11 times higher than the price of natural gas elsewhere in the nation Carpenter said. ??I have never seen gas prices like this anywhere in the world said Carpenter who has been studying the energy market for 20 years for Cambridge Mass.-based consultant The Brattle Group. The Brattle Group was hired by Edison to study the natural gas market. ??The committee is one of two legislative committees exploring whether illegal market manipulation in the electricity and natural gas markets has driven up California's energy costs. ??This is a market that is plagued by the exercise of market power Frank Wolak chairman of the California Independent System Operator's Market Surveillance Committee told the Senate Select Committee to Investigate Price Manipulation of the Wholesale Energy Market. The ISO runs the state's power grid. ??However there is no law against me saying 'I'm not going to sell to you' Wolak said. Market manipulation only becomes illegal when there is collusion Wolak said and such evidence is hard to find. ??Electricity generators and natural gas suppliers say a severe supply and demand imbalance - not market manipulation - has led to higher prices. ??Everybody's busy doing investigations. They're not interested in solving the problem said Independent Energy Producers Executive Director Jan Smutny-Jones. ??Investigations are wasting everybody's time Smutny-Jones said adding that previous probes and lawsuits have uncovered no wrongdoing. He said the state's power problems came because state regulators denied utilities the chance to sign long-term energy contracts when they had the chance. ??People have been playing by the rules Smutny-Jones said. ??But the Senate committee's first witnesses are ISO officials who authored studies that claim the state paid more than $6 billion too much for power last year. ??Committee chair Joseph Dunn D-Garden Grove also has slated state Auditor Elaine Howell who last month blamed buyers and sellers for skyrocketing electricity costs. Dunn also has scheduled future testimony from state federal academic and private investigators studying the power market. ??He invited five major generators to attend the committee's second hearing next week. All five - Reliant Dynegy Williams Energy Duke Energy and Mirant - say they are eager to cooperate and clear their names Dunn said. ??Dunn asked the five for a total of 86 specific documents. If the companies feel they cannot provide documents because of legal or confidentiality concerns Dunn said he will subpoena them. ??Smutny-Jones said investigators appear to be growing desperate to blame the state's natural gas and electricity price hikes on illegal market manipulation instead of natural market forces. ??He cited Attorney General Bill Lockyer's announcement last week that any informant who helped prove wrongdoing would be entitled to a percentage of the state's recovery he estimated could range from $50 million to hundreds of millions of dollars. ??If the state's offering a $50 million reward they haven't found anything Smutny-Jones said.

It's obviously way higher than $100 million. ??Natural gas rates at the California border generally tracked national prices until November when they spiked as high as 11 times higher than the price of natural gas elsewhere in the nation Carpenter said. ??I have never seen gas prices like this anywhere in the world said Carpenter who has been studying the energy market for 20 years for Cambridge Mass.-based consultant The Brattle Group. The Brattle Group was hired by Edison to study the natural gas market. ??Officials with El Paso and other natural gas suppliers have denied illegally manipulating the market. They are scheduled to testify Thursday. El Paso officials did not return telephone calls for comment Wednesday. ??The committee is one of two legislative committees exploring whether illegal market manipulation in the electricity and natural gas markets has driven up California's energy costs. ??This is a market that is plagued by the exercise of market power Frank Wolak chairman of the California Independent System Operator's Market Surveillance Committee told the Senate Select Committee to Investigate Price Manipulation of the Wholesale Energy Market. The ISO runs the state's power grid. ??However there is no law against me saying 'I'm not going to sell to you' Wolak said. Market manipulation only becomes illegal when there is collusion Wolak said and such evidence is hard to find. ??Electricity generators and natural gas suppliers say a severe supply and demand imbalance - not market manipulation - has led to higher prices. ??Everybody's busy doing investigations. They're not interested in solving the problem said Independent Energy Producers Executive Director Jan Smutny-Jones. ??Investigations are wasting everybody's time Smutny-Jones said adding that previous probes and lawsuits have uncovered no wrongdoing. He said the state's power problems came because state regulators denied utilities the chance to sign long-term energy contracts when they had the chance. ??People have been playing by the rules Smutny-Jones said. ??But the Senate committee's first witnesses are ISO officials who authored studies that claim the state paid more than $6 billion too much for power last year. ??Committee chair Joseph Dunn D-Garden Grove also has slated state Auditor Elaine Howell who last month blamed buyers and sellers for skyrocketing electricity costs. Dunn also has scheduled future testimony from state federal academic and private investigators studying the power market. ??He invited five major generators to attend the committee's second hearing next week. All five - Reliant Dynegy Williams Energy Duke Energy and Mirant - say they are eager to cooperate and clear their names Dunn said. ??Dunn asked the five for a total of 86 specific documents. If the companies feel they cannot provide documents because of legal or confidentiality concerns Dunn said he will subpoena them. ??Smutny-Jones said investigators appear to be growing desperate to blame the state's natural gas and electricity price hikes on illegal market manipulation instead of natural market forces. ??He cited Attorney General Bill Lockyer's announcement last week that any informant who helped prove wrongdoing would be entitled to a percentage of the state's recovery he estimated could range from $50 million to hundreds of millions of dollars. ??If the state's offering a $50 million reward they haven't found anything Smutny-Jones said. I don't think you're going to find the fact that anybody did anything criminal here. ??Assemblywoman Jenny Oropeza D-Long Beach said she believes otherwise after Wednesday's testimony: I think it is very clear there was some price manipulation going on. ??But Assemblyman John Campbell R-Irvine isn't sure there was anything illegal. ??There clearly are market forces at work that's evident Campbell said.

LOAD-DATE: April 19 2001 Power bloc blasts seizure idea Producers say talk of bold action fuels crisis By Steve Geissinger SACRAMENTO BUREAU ?-- Oakland Tribune SACRAMENTO -- Outraged by a report in The Oakland Tribune that some lawmakers asked the governor to seize high-priced power contracts a key industry group Tuesday warned the Davis administration and Legislature that such action would worsen the energy crisis. We're publicly saying . . . this kind of rhetoric will have dire consequences on both the reliability and cost of power in California for years to come said Jan Smutny-Jones executive director of the Independent Energy Producers Association. It is the kind of rhetoric one would expect in Indonesia or the Philippines not the sixth largest economy on the planet he said in a teleconference. At the same time Davis administration officials confirmed that seizing contracts of allegedly profiteering brokers is the most likely last-ditch move if options continue to narrow ahead of the previously discussed concepts of seizing California power plants owned by out-of-state firms or passing a windfall profits tax. Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio pointed out the governor already seized power contracts on which California's investor-owned utilities were defaulting in early February. The state trying to buy its way out of the energy crisis with no clear end in sight lost a substantial measure of control over electricity prices and supplies to the courts with the recent bankruptcy filing by the Pacific Gas and Electric Co. Gov. Gray Davis a Democrat employed hard-sell tactics Tuesday in an effort to convince reluctant Democrats that their failure to embrace his plan to financially rescue teetering Southern California Edison could plunge that utility into bankruptcy as well. While most Republicans are flatly opposed to the plan as misguided Democrats who hold a majority in the Legislature worry it's a public bailout of an investor-owned utility and would hand the state control over only Edison's south-state piece of the strategic high-voltage transmission grid in California. Soaring wholesale power costs have financially shattered utilities forcing the state into runaway multibillion-dollar spending that helps keep the lights on but threatens the state budget. The manager of the state's power grid has accused generators and marketers of overcharging Californians more than $6 billion in recent months. Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg D-Van Nuys said Monday that members of both legislative houses were interested in seizure of California power plants' contracts with brokers who sell to customers within or outside the state. Sen. Don Perata D-Oakland an outspoken critic of the Davis administration's handling of the crisis said some lawmakers had asked the governor to use emergency or eminent domain powers to seize the overpriced contracts and were awaiting Davis' answer this week. Supporters of the move said seizure would allow the state to control where the power is sold and decrease price markups by eliminating the middleman. But myriad questions remain unanswered including regulatory and interstate commerce issues as well as any state reimbursement of the brokers. Any move to seize power contracts would be overturned by the courts said Gary Ackerman executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum. Instead of trying to do what's legally within their reach they go to extreme measures that are on their very face unlawful and unconstitutional Ackerman said. Moreover industry officials said seizure would not only chill industry investment in California's power system and lead to higher power costs but would be ironic since California has shunned lower-cost long-term contracts industry officials said. It would create a very unstable political regulatory environment Smutny-Jones said. It would have extremely adverse consequences for California in the long term. Even so the talk has worried the industry. Smutny-Jones said his clients are very very troubled by this sudden turn in rhetoric. I assume when senior members of the Legislature make pronouncements about potentially seizing contracts it's designed to get our attention and we obviously take those things seriously he said. The Independent Energy Producers group is in the process of contacting the Davis administration and lawmakers said Smutny-Jones. You'll hear more about this.

Natural gas is a critical part of the electricity crisis because most of the state's generating plants run on natural gas. ??Natural-gas prices have soared throughout the nation but the bench mark price paid at California's border has been double that paid at other bench mark locations throughout the nation for months according to figures released by the Assembly Subcommittee on Energy Oversight. ??Next week Carpenter plans to testify at hearings in Washington D.C. on behalf of Southern California Edison and the California Public Utilities Commission which are asking federal regulators to intervene. ??The giant utility and the state regulatory body contend that a sweetheart deal between El Paso Natural Gas and El Paso Merchant Energy gave the sister companies enough market power to artificially raise the price of natural gas that flows into Southern California from Texas. ??El Paso owns the major pipeline bringing natural gas from fields in New Mexico and Texas to Southern California. El Paso Merchant Energy is an unregulated sister company. ??Carpenter called the prices paid in Southern California ''simply unprecedented'' in the United States. He estimated that the sister companies manipulated the market enough to add $2.60 to the price of a million British thermal units of gas. ??In addition he said El Paso Merchant Energy owns part of 20 smaller power plants ''qualifying facilities'' that get paid based on the price of natural gas in California. The higher natural-gas prices increase the company's revenues Carpenter said. ??El Paso company officials are expected to testify in front of the Assembly subcommittee today but in proceedings before the federal regulators they have denied any sweetheart deal. ??In a report they commissioned the company blamed the higher natural-gas prices in Southern California on increased demand and constraints on pipeline capacity. ??Gov. Gray Davis meanwhile gave his strongest endorsement yet to a windfall-profits tax on generators as a Senate committee chaired by Joseph Dunn D-Laguna Niguel began a series of hearings to probe possible price gouging by generators. ??''I believe the Legislature would be well within its prerogative to insist that generators receive an appropriate reduction whether it's 20 percent or any other number the Legislature hit upon'' Davis said. ??Senate Democrats Davis said will form a special committee to help work on his plan for the state purchase of the transmission system of Southern California Edison for $2.76 billion in exchange for state aid in paying off the utilities' debt. ??The governor said he told Senate Democrats a number of whom are skeptical of the plan that Edison's parent firm has agreed to back a $3 billion upgrade of the neighborhood distribution system retained by Edison and to return a $400 million tax refund to the utility. ??At the natural-gas hearing yesterday state officials said that after El Paso Merchant Energy bought a significant part of the pipeline capacity from its sister company it withheld natural gas to drive prices up. ??''Marketers have gamed the system and figured out how to hoard capacity and undermine competition'' said Harvey Morris an attorney for the California Public Utilities Commission. ??State regulators want the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission which regulates natural gas to open the market to more competitors. ??But the commission has repeatedly rejected similar complaints in the past. On March 28 FERC ruled that the affiliates did not arrange a sweetheart deal. ??''The fact that El Paso Merchant controls a large volume of capacity does not in and of itself render the El Paso contracts unjust unreasonable or unduly discriminatory'' FERC ruled. ??In other cases involving natural gas federal regulators acknowledged that certain contract provisions allowed anti-competitive behavior but they approved those contracts anyway. ??Lawmakers said they were puzzled by the federal regulators' lack of action. ??''It baffles me that we've found the problem anti-competitive behavior and market gaming but there's no cure because federal regulators won't take action'' said Assemblyman Juan Vargas D-San Diego.

Not going to happen Vice President Dick Cheney insists. Don't waste your energy thinking about it. ??Frankly California is looked on by many folks as a classic example of the kinds of problems that arise when you do use price caps Cheney said in a telephone interview Wednesday. ??The vice president was referring to another type of price cap--the infamous state cap on consumer rates that has left the private utilities billions short of enough revenue to pay their gouging wholesalers. What political leaders in California and the Northwest are pleading for from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is a regional cap on wholesale prices. ??Early last year a megawatt-hour was selling wholesale in California for $ 30. By year's end it had risen to an average $ 300 according to state officials. At peak prices have soared to $ 1500. Meanwhile demand increased last year by less than 4%. In fact demand last month was 9% less than in March 2000. ??This is the sorry news for ratepayers/ taxpayers: Californians paid $ 7.4 billion for electricity in 1999. This year the tab--without price caps--is projected at $ 70 billion. Gov. Gray Davis disclosed Tuesday that his administration has been shelling out $ 73 million a day to buy electricity for the pauper utilities. ??The profits of power producers--many of them Texans and Bush backers--have risen 400%-500%-600%. ??* ??But none of this budges the Bush administration. ??Price caps Cheney declares may provide short-term political relief for the politicians. But they don't do anything to deal with the basic fundamental problem. That problem is supply he says price caps discourage investment in new power plants and encourage consumption. ??Counters Garry South Davis' political strategist: The notion by free market zanies that you have to let profits rise 500%-600% is ludicrous. Reasonable profits can be made without bankrupting the system. They're just trying to protect the profits of their friends in the energy business. ??In truth California is building power plants as fast as it can. But not enough new megawatts apparently will be online by summer to prevent blackouts--and the bleeding of billions more into the pockets of out-of-state profiteers. ??How about a temporary price cap? ??Six months? Six years? Cheney replies. Once politicians can no longer resist the temptation to go with price caps they usually are unable to ever muster the courage to end them . . . ??I don't see that as a possibility . . . Any package you can wrap it in any fancy rhetoric you can prop it up with it does not solve the problem. ??* ??The White House clearly understands it has a problem in California--a political problem. A problem with a Democratic-dominated state that voted overwhelmingly for Al Gore. And now a problem with that mythical headline--Bush to California: Drop Dead--which seems to be getting bigger each day. ??There have been several recent California: Drop Dead stories. One was in Sunday's New York Times--Bush Devoting Scanty Attention to California. Tuesday the Sacramento Bee reported that when Cheney met with Northwest members of Congress to discuss West Coast energy he barred Californians from the room. ??Cheney flatly denies it. ??But Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) says she has had trouble making contact with the Bush White House. She has sent two letters to President Bush asking for a meeting on energy. The first time she got back a form letter with her name misspelled. On the second try she got a group meeting with Cheney. ??It was very disappointing she says. He spoke about letting the free market work and drilling in Alaska . That's not going to help California in the short-term. We need price caps until we're able to fix this very broken market. . . ??There seems no interest in really wanting to understand the California situation. ??I asked Cheney whether he sensed an anti-California bias across the country? No more than there's an anti-Texas bias he replied. I wouldn't get paranoid about it. ??The fact is California is one of the leading states in the nation. Often a trendsetter. . . . Well we hope not to emulate your energy policy. Hopefully we'll learn from that. ??His message to California: There's no reason not to be optimistic. The energy crunch obviously is a significant problem. . . . But it too will pass. ??While learning from California the Bush White House also might take a refresher course in the free market Hoover administration.

BYLINE: JENIFER WARREN and TERENCE MONMANEY TIMES STAFF WRITERS DATELINE: SACRAMENTO BODY: ??Attempting to show that no region in California is safe from sacrifice Gov. Gray Davis on Wednesday called for quick state approval of a controversial power plant proposed for the Silicon Valley. ??The governor's action locks him in combat with the San Jose City Council which has unanimously rejected the plant and Cisco Systems the computer networking giant that wants to build its worldwide headquarters on adjacent land. ??In praising the proposed plant as a model of low-polluting efficiency Davis said all regions of California must share the pain as the state expands its power supply--a key step toward ending blackouts and reducing sky-high electricity prices. ??If approved the plant would be the 14th licensed by the California Energy Commission since Davis took office. The 13th--a 510-megawatt plant near San Diego--was approved unanimously by the commission Wednesday with little controversy. ??Rushing to expand the state's overtaxed energy supply the governor has recently cut in half the approval times for the licensing of some plants. Six are under construction according to Davis and three are scheduled to begin operation this summer. A fourth--the AES Corp. generator in Huntington Beach that is due to be restarted --could add more megawatts to the supply this summer. ??V. John White an energy consultant in Sacramento said the governor's newly active role as an advocate for power plants was a necessary step given the urgency of the supply shortage. ??It's very rare and I wouldn't want him to short-circuit the commission's review process White said. But I think he's trying to reassure folks we're doing everything we can and not just sitting around in our hot tubs. ??Davis urged the Energy Commission--a five-member panel dominated by his appointees--to stop talking about the project and grant it a license. If the commission does so it will mark only the third time the panel has usurped a local government's authority over zoning. ??We are all in this together Davis said flanked by a forest of electric transformers near the Capitol. We are one state and we all have to make the sacrifices necessary to make up for the mistakes of the last 12 years when no major power plants were built. ??The governor said the plant's developers Calpine Corp. and Bechtel Enterprises Holdings Inc. have made numerous concessions to San Jose officials including an agreement to sell power exclusively in the region. ??He added that the $ 300-million plant--expected to supply about 450000 homes--will be equipped with state-of-the-art systems that make it one of the cleanest plants to go up in the nation. ??The commission's staff has recommended licensing the project and some analysts said the governor's intervention--said to be unprecedented--should fuel momentum for approval. ??Commissioner Robert Laurie--one of two members who held evidentiary hearings on the project and is preparing a recommendation for the full commission--would not comment on the plant's prospects. But Laurie an appointee of former Gov. Pete Wilson insisted that the project would receive an impartial review. ??I know the importance of independent decision-making he said. ??San Jose officials say the Calpine project conflicts with the aesthetics of its site in a bucolic valley 15 miles south of downtown. On Wednesday Mayor Ron Gonzales urged the Energy Commission to give serious attention to the city's concerns about the plant's potential impact on residents and the environment. ??As the project has been designed and proposed to operate . . . it would present an unfair burden to our community the mayor said. ??A spokeswoman for the Calpine/Bechtel partnership disagreed and characterized the plant as key to restoring energy stability in the Silicon Valley a region heavily dependent on imported power. ??This is the only project in the pipeline that can help Silicon Valley out of its predicament in the near future said the spokeswoman Lisa Poelle. ??She expressed hope that the governor's comments which cap numerous meetings between the partnership staff and Davis aides would encourage San Jose to soften its stance on the project. ??The 600-megawatt plant is proposed for a swath of open space currently leased to a rancher and occupied by grazing cattle. A preliminary ruling by Laurie and the other commissioner scrutinizing the project is expected by June. The full commission would take a final vote about a month later and if a license were granted the plant would begin operations sometime in 2003. ??From the beginning the plant has been dogged by opposition and the Energy Commission has held more than 20 hearings--an unusually large number--on its fate. ??On Wednesday a spokesman for its heftiest foe San Jose-based Cisco said the company still has serious concerns about health and safety issues. ??Cisco has strongly opposed the plant because the company wants to build a $ 1.3-billion headquarters for 20000 employees nearby. In the past Cisco officials have threatened to relocate to another state if the power plant is built. ??Company spokesman Steve Langdon said the firm's plans to build an industrial campus were not scuttled by the announcement Monday that it is cutting 8500 workers from its payroll because of slumping sales of its Internet networking equipment. ??But he suggested that the plans were flexible enough to be scaled down for a smaller work force and that the campus may not house the company's headquarters. ??It doesn't all get built at once he said. We will build and occupy the site over time in phases as needed. ??Another leading opponent of the power plant argued Wednesday that the Energy Commission lacks authority to override San Jose officials and license the project. The Santa Teresa Citizen Action Group launched by homeowners near the site says the commission may only take such a step if a better plant site hasn't been identified. ??The group charges that the commission is aware of other available sites including one in an industrial part of the East Bay area and lists eight other reasons the plant should not be built among them the noise and emissions it would produce. ??The local Sierra Club chapter however has endorsed the plant largely on grounds that it would run cleaner than existing plants in the area. By offsetting emissions from those older plants the new project would actually reduce air pollution said Kurt Newick of the Sierra Club's Loma Prieta chapter. ??On another front Davis continued to lobby legislators for support for his plan to rescue Southern California Edison from bankruptcy through purchase of the utility's transmission grid. ??Emerging from lunch with state Senate Democrats who are openly wary of the deal Davis said he'd made progress to bridge some of the gaps. It was the governor's third meeting in two days with lawmakers of both parties. ??Some of the toughest skeptics are members of his own party in the Senate. Many fear that the deal Davis struck with Edison will hand the utility too much at the expense of ratepayers and some say bankruptcy might be a better option for the state's second-largest private utility. Pacific Gas & Electric Co. filed for bankruptcy April 6. ??To assuage concerns Davis proposed that a special Senate committee be named to meet with his energy advisors as the administration and Edison finalize details of the deal before it goes to the Legislature for approval. ??Senate leader John Burton (D-San Francisco) who has called the Edison agreement problematic said he may appoint such a committee but continued to suggest that an Edison bankruptcy might be acceptable. ??Many of the Fortune 100 companies have gone into Chapter 11 bankruptcy and it ain't like the end of the world for anybody Burton said. ??* ??Times staff writer Carl Ingram contributed to this story. ??Powering Up California ??Power plant projects recently licensed by the California Energy Commission and when they are expected to go online: ??* ??* Two of four turbines are expected to go online in December 2001 the other two are expected to go online in March 2002. ??Source: California Energy Commission GRAPHIC: PHOTO: (2 photos) Gov.

Consequently its customers' power rates are expected to be stable this year while Pacific Gas and Electric Co. customers face huge rate increases. ???But municipal utilities such as Alameda's are still part of the statewide power grid which is managed by the Independent System Operator and are subject to rolling blackouts like everybody else when the state's energy reserves dip below 1.5 percent. ???Each of Alameda's four diesel generators will produce 1.5 megawatts of power.

Gray Davis' assertion that the state is being gouged by power companies because of PG&E's bankruptcy filing. ???Such dissent from the governor's own subordinates could make it harder for Davis to gain support for his energy measures in the state Legislature. ???Despite Davis' latest claims the Department of Water Resources which is spending about $70 million a day buying power said there is no evidence linking recent price increases to Pacific Gas and Electric Co. filing for bankruptcy protection on April 6. ???It is a seller's market said Viju Patel executive manager of the Department of Water Resources' power systems department. The power companies do not need an excuse to raise prices. ???Critics say Davis' penchant for secrecy on energy issues has come back to haunt him at a time when he needs all the allies he can find. ???People aren't taking his words at face value said Michael Shames executive director of the Utility Consumers' Action Network in San Diego. ???Republican lawmakers -- and even some Democrats -- have challenged a number of the governor's initiatives including a multibillion-dollar bailout scheme for Southern California Edison. ???Nevertheless Davis reiterated his belief yesterday that recent electricity price increases are an aberration driven by the bankruptcy of PG&E. ???He said California's spending on power jumped 40 percent in the week following PG&E's bankruptcy filing because generators say they face a greater risk of not being paid. ???Nothing else in the equation has changed said Steve Maviglio a spokesman for the governor. Everything is the same except the bankruptcy. ???However power companies were quick to challenge this assertion. They insisted that PG&E's bankruptcy actually was seen as a positive development by those in the energy business. ???If anything PG&E provides some solace for traders because the bankruptcy provides an organized mechanism for recovery of payments said Gary Ackerman executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum a Menlo Park energy-industry association. ???On the other hand he acknowledged that power companies are becoming increasingly wary of the state of California's creditworthiness as an energy buyer. ???The Department of Water Resources already has spent nearly $5 billion buying electricity and has yet to recoup a dime from ratepayers. State regulators are still trying to come up with a way to apportion the limited revenues from power rates among the various parties in California's energy picture. ???Rating agency Fitch Inc. said yesterday it may cut the state's credit rating because of questions surrounding recovery of energy costs. ???People are keeping an eye on things Ackerman said. They're watching how California finances things. ???If a premium on electricity sales to the state exists he said it probably has been in place since the beginning of the year well before PG&E's current woes. ???UCAN's Shames agreed. He said power companies added a risk premium to their California power sales late last year when it looked like the state's energy troubles were worsening. ???PG&E's bankruptcy may have increased the uncertainty Shames said but we've been paying a risk premium for months now. ???Richard Wheatley a spokesman for Reliant Energy in Houston insisted that his company's traders are not using questions about PG&E's or California's financial solvency as a fresh excuse for higher prices. ???I haven't seen any evidence of it he said. ???Mark Palmer a spokesman for Houston's Enron Corp. laid blame for recent price increases on low rainfall throughout the West which has cut output at hydroelectric facilities as well as on California's chronic power shortage. ???It's not that there's a premium on prices he said. It's just supply and demand. ???That said Palmer acknowledged that California's firm insistance on blackouts being avoided at all costs leaves the state vulnerable to virtually any price generators choose to demand. ???This means prices will be used to allocate a scarce resource he said. There's no other way it could work. ???Bottom line for consumers: It's going to be a long hot summer and electricity prices will soar even higher as demand surges. ???And despite the best efforts of state officials a daily threat of blackouts remains a virtual certainty as California's beleaguered power grid is stretched to the breaking point. ???At the Department of Water Resources' command center in a Sacramento shopping mall the state's team of electricity traders has moved onto a new high-tech trading floor where they negotiate power deals each day from the crack of dawn. ???The department's Patel said daily blackouts may be averted this summer after consumers see skyrocketing power prices reflected in their bills. ???People will respond to these prices and they are going to conserve like never before Patel predicted.E-mail David Lazarus at dlazarus@sfchronicle.com.

Gray Davis urged the state Energy Commission yesterday to approve a controversial power plant in San Jose saying California needs every megawatt it can harness. ???Davis' recommendation runs counter to the wishes of the San Jose City Council and Mayor Ron Gonzales who have come out against the 600-megawatt Metcalf Energy Center in south San Jose's Coyote Valley. It also puts the governor at odds with one of his political allies Cisco Systems chief John Chambers whose company opposes the plant because it would be built near the tech firm's proposed new campus. ???Davis' announcement came the same day he all but admitted he lacks the support he needs in the state Senate for the deal he reached with Southern California Edison to restore the utility to financial health. Davis has portrayed that deal and construction of new power plants as essential to making California's energy market functional again. ???I think when we have an opportunity to put more power on line we should seize it Davis said. I believe we spend too much time talking about Metcalf. It's time to start building it. ???The Energy Commission has been reviewing the proposal by Calpine Corp. and Bechtel Enterprises Inc. for months. The commission's staff recommended in October that the plant be built and a final decision is expected by summer. If it is approved the plant could come on line next year and provide enough electricity for 600000 homes. ???None of the five commissioners could be reached yesterday. Three are Democrats appointed by Davis and two are Republicans appointed by former Gov. Pete Wilson. ???Gonzales and the rest of the City Council rejected the Metcalf plant in November. Until yesterday Davis had sat on the sidelines as the energy crisis deepened and a long line of state and federal officials including four of the five Assembly members from Silicon Valley urged the commission to overturn the council's vote. ???Some neighborhood groups oppose the plant along with computer networking giant Cisco which hopes to build a 20000-worker campus on a neighboring parcel. Cisco chief Chambers donated $50000 to Davis in the first six months of last year. ???Cisco's reaction yesterday was restrained. ???We have great respect for the governor and respect his decision said Cisco spokesman Steve Langdon. ???However Langdon added: We still have serious concerns about health and safety issues related to the proposed power plant. ???Some neighbors were much angrier. ???He's trying to act like he's the big bad tough governor and he's spineless said Issa Ajlouny who lives in the Santa Teresa neighborhood less than a mile from the proposed plant. He knows the approval process isn't working in his favor so he's trying to come out and act like a hero to the state of California. But he's nothing but backstabbing the city of San Jose on the environmental issues. ???Supporters of the plant see the 14 acres of former junkyard as the perfect site -- right next to Pacific Gas and Electric Co.'s largest substation in the South Bay close to major transmission lines and shielded from its neighbors by a 350-foot hill. ???But a housing development is also nearby and residents fear the power plant will belch pollutants in an area already suffering from some of the worst air quality in the Bay Area. ???Mayor Gonzales continued to express his concern yesterday. ???I would support clean power plants that will help us achieve greater energy self-sufficiency for San Jose residents and business Gonzales said. As the Metcalf project has been designed and proposed to operate however it would present an unfair burden on our community. ???That's not what Davis said however calling Metcalf one of the cleanest most efficient plants in the country. ???Davis praised the efforts of Calpine/Bechtel to work with the local community and said he was especially pleased that the venture had agreed to commit all the power to the local region. ???The Silicon Valley is obviously the engine driving our economy but they are very dependent on outside power Davis said. ???Also in Sacramento yesterday after an hourlong session with Senate Democrats -- the toughest legislative sell for Davis' proposed Edison deal -- the governor all but admitted his plan could not win enough votes for Senate approval. ???I think he knew there weren't enough votes going in said Sen. Don Perata D-Oakland. But there may be a way of perfecting a deal people can at least think of supporting. ???Senate Democrats have openly opposed Edison's deal saying the only beneficiaries are Edison shareholders and power generators who would be paid every cent owed them by the utility -- at the expense of customers who would pay more to erase Edison's debt. ???Unlike his meeting with Assembly Democrats after which Davis said he was encouraged the governor said yesterday he wanted the Senate to appoint a special committee to iron out differences over the Edison deal. ???Senate President Pro Tem John Burton D-San Francisco said he was not aware a committee was being set up. He said he favored an up-or-down vote on Davis' current proposal.Chronicle staff writers Greg Lucas Alan Gathright and Maria Alicia Gaura contributed to this report. / E-mail Lynda Gledhill at lgledhill@sfchronicle.com.

Hydro's credit to California firms exceeded 1999 guidelines BYLINE: David Baines SOURCE: Vancouver Sun BODY: ??A confidential document issued in late 1999 shows that B.C. Hydro's power-trading subsidiary Powerex set a credit limit of $100 million US for its California customers. ??However by the end of 2000 Powerex had extended three times that amount of credit to those customers -- the California Independent System Operator and the California Power Exchange. With the California Power Exchange and Cal-ISO's major customer Pacific Gas & Electric under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection repayment of this debt is now in doubt. ??Powerex spokesman Wayne Cousins noted that the document obtained by The Vancouver Sun which is marked strictly confidential was issued in November 1999. ??That's an old copy of our risk-management policy he said in an interview Wednesday. ??Credit limits have changed since then based on careful assessment of several factors including market conditions risks maintaining long-standing relationships and helping California meet its electricity needs to prevent crisis situations. ??Temporary revisions were only implemented after very diligent review incorporating the best market intelligence available our own due diligence and on-going dialogue with appropriate market participants. ??He refused to say when the credit limits for Cal-ISO and the California Power Exchange were increased. ??That type of information is confidential. You have a copy that I assume was leaked in some way but this is commercially confidential information. ??He said the increase in credit limits helped B.C. Hydro achieve record net income of about $1 billion during the year ending March 31. This figures does not include any write-downs that may occur if Powerex determines that any of its customer accounts are not collectible. ??Cousins however was insistent that all debts will be collected: We continue to pursue monies owing and we expect to be paid for electricity we have sold. ??He noted that Powerex suspended trades to all California entities on Dec. 8 unless those trades were fully secured by creditworthy customers. ??By that time Cal-ISO and California had racked up an unpaid bill of about $ 300 million US or $475 million Cdn -- about half the net income that Hydro has tentatively reported for the year ending March 31. ??The confidential document states that Powerex's policies and procedures are designed to control the risk of financial loss due to changes in market prices or volatility and the risk that a counterparty (customer) in a commodity transaction defaults on delivery and/or settlement. ??It states that the amount of credit to be advanced to any customer depends on its credit rating. An AAA customer for example may be granted credit to a maximum of $20 million. ??Cal-ISO and California Power Exchange are not utilities they are power pools. They purchase power from Powerex and other suppliers and re-sell it to utilities such as Pacific Gas & Electric and Southern California Edison. ??The pools are not rated but are assigned specific credit limits. As of November 1999 Cal-ISO had a credit limit of $40 million US and the California Power Exchange $60 million US. ??The risk-management document notes that the credit-worthiness of these pools depends on that of its suppliers. ??The Powerex credit-risk manager and the treasury manager are responsible for initially evaluating and then monitoring the credit-authorization policies and credit limits for each power pool in which Powerex trades the document states. Significant alterations in the credit policies of a power pool will trigger a mandatory reappraisal of the power-pool credit limit. ??California has been caught in a power vice in recent months. The problem dates back to 1996 when the state developed a plan to deregulate the electricity business. Competition was supposed to lower rates below a price cap that had been imposed. ??However dry conditions cut the ability to generate hydro-electric power and a surge in the state's economy created unprecedented demand for electricity. Prices soared. ??The result was that the California utilities paid record prices for power but weren't allowed to pass along the full cost to consumers. ??Pacific Gas & Electric and Southern California Edison the state's two biggest utilities now owe about $12 billion. ??dbaines@pacpress.southam.ca TYPE: Business LOAD-DATE: April 19 2001 of 63 DOCUMENTS ???????????????????The Associated Press State & Local Wire The materials in the AP file were compiled by The Associated Press. ?These materials may not be republished without the express written consent of The Associated Press. ?????????????????????April 18 2001 Wednesday BC cycle SECTION: Business News LENGTH: 348 words HEADLINE: Williams again target of overcharging allegations from federal regulators DATELINE: TULSA Okla.

BODY: ??Gov. Mike Johanns and Rep. Lee Terry R-Neb. said Wednesday they will be working to make sure national leaders understand Nebraska's stance on a national energy policy. ??Nebraska's unique status as the only 100 percent public power state in the nation and its reliance on the corn-based fuel additive ethanol make the state's input in the development of national energy policy important Johanns said. ??Public power has worked very well for Nebraska consumers by providing low cost electricity he said adding that the deregulated state of California has suffered through weeks of rolling blackouts. We are committed to protecting public power in this environment of deregulation. ??Terry said he has talked at length to the staff of Vice President Dick Cheney who has been tapped to come up with a national energy policy draft. That draft will end up before the House Energy and Commerce Committee on which Terry serves. ??There will be a discussion about a national deregulation policy Terry said. ??A national deregulation policy would threaten Nebraska's public power system Terry and Johanns said.

Gray Davis is expected to announce today his support for Calpine Corp.'s proposed South San Jose power plant -- a move that could ensure the state's most controversial power project is built. ??Davis said for months that he would not interfere in the environmental review of the proposed 600-megawatt power plant. But a source close to the governor said Davis has decided to use Calpine's Coyote Valley project to send a signal that California is ready to build more power plants and is open to business. ??San Jose has strenuously opposed the power plant. But Davis' decision to urge the California Energy Commission to approve it would likely hold sway with the agency which has authority over where plants are located but has almost never overridden local opposition. ??The commission -- three of whose five members were appointed by Davis -- is expected to complete its environmental review and make a decision early this summer. ??A spokesman for the governor declined to confirm the endorsement. But late Tuesday the governor scheduled a press conference for this morning to make an important energy generation announcement. ??San Jose Mayor Ron Gonzales declined to comment. But another of the plant's leading opponents pledged to keep fighting what would be the South Bay's largest power plant. ??An endorsement from Davis would cap a stunning turnaround for the project. ??Five months ago Calpine's Metcalf Energy Center was unanimously rejected by the San Jose City Council which decided that the power plant would be incompatible with the city's plans to develop high-tech campuses in North Coyote Valley. ??Some Calpine officials even considered giving up plans to build the power plant. ??But as California's energy woes intensified the Metcalf plant increasingly became a poster child for the need for more power generation to reduce the skyrocketing cost of electricity and avoid rolling blackouts. Silicon Valley one of the state's largest electricity consumers produces only a fraction of the energy it uses. ??Despite fierce opposition from local residents concerned about the environmental effects of a large power plant a steady stream of state and local organizations lined up behind the project including the Silicon Valley Manufacturing Group the San Jose Silicon Valley Chamber of Commerce and the local chapters of the Sierra Club and American Lung Association. ??The California Assembly voted unanimously in February to urge the energy commission to override San Jose and license the power plant. ??And top officials and attorneys at the energy commission have been working for months to ensure that the project wins approval a Mercury News investigation of the commission's environmental review of the project showed. The officials undermined negative environmental assessments of the Metcalf site and silenced commission analysts who said other sites would be better. ??The energy commissioners are weighing the staff's recommendation to approve the plant. ??Commissioner Robert A. Laurie who oversaw hearings on the project insisted at one hearing two months ago that the commission would complete an independent review. ??Although Davis has stressed his efforts to speed construction of new power plants the governor insisted he would not take a position on the project. ??The governor has repeatedly said he wants the process to play out Davis press secretary Steve Maviglio said last week. The governor believes the energy commission should complete its review. ??But there have been growing signs that Davis would throw his weight behind Calpine's project. ??A senior energy commission official said aides to the governor have been calling the commission for months to urge quick approval of the Metcalf plant. The governor's press secretary said no calls have been made. ??When Davis was looking for a backdrop to hold a press conference earlier this year to announce his plans to speed up approval of new power plants he chose Calpine's new plant in Sutter. ??The company also has actively campaigned for the governor's support. ??Earlier this year Calpine offered to sell the state cheaper power from the plant if it is approved. ??When Calpine and its development partner Bechtel Enterprises were looking for a lobbyist in Sacramento the companies turned to Platinum Advisors whose president Darius Anderson was finance chairman of Davis' 1998 gubernatorial campaign. ??The San Jose-based company gave the governor $ 19000 last year according to state campaign finance reports. ??Maviglio said the governor's ties to Calpine are no different from his relationship with Cisco Systems CEO John Chambers who has opposed the power plant. Campaign finance reports show Chambers gave Davis $ 50000 last year. ??Calpine officials said Tuesday they did not know of the governor's impending announcement. But they said they were not surprised. We've been working with the governor on a number of issues said project manager Ken Abreu. Metcalf is just one of them. ??Meanwhile Calpine's opponents in San Jose City Hall and in the neighborhood nearest the proposed power plant appear more isolated than at any time since the contentious debate over the Metcalf site began more than two years ago. ??Mayor Gonzales refused to comment on Davis' planned announcement. I don't respond to rumors said the mayor who has helped lead opposition to Metcalf. I have not heard anything. If he makes a statement I'll respond. ??But one of Calpine's fiercest local opponents said the nearby Santa Teresa neighborhood will continue to fight. We have a strong case said longtime South San Jose resident Issa Ajlouny. And we will win. ??The Mercury News strives to avoid use of unnamed sources.

BODY: ??Gov. Gray Davis indicated Wednesday that he may need to alter the agreement to purchase Southern California Edison's transmission lines if he wants legislators to approve the deal. ??Though the Democratic governor declined to discuss particulars he said he asked Senate leaders to appoint a special committee dedicated to resolving disagreements between the administration and lawmakers. ??Many provisions of the memorandum of understanding the document that lays out the terms of the Edison deal must be approved by the Legislature and the state Public Utilities Commission. ??There is a determination to try and solve this problem whether or not it means amending the MOU or trying a slightly different approach Davis said after meeting with Senate Democrats. ??A spokesman for the utility declined to comment on the governor's statements. ??Davis announced the Edison agreement April 9 just three days after Pacific Gas & Electric Co. unexpectedly cut off transmission line negotiations with the governor and filed for bankruptcy protection. ??The deal would require the state to pay $2.76 billion for Edison's transmission lines or 2.3 times book value. In addition a portion of consumer electricity rates would be dedicated to paying off the remainder of the utility's debt estimated at about $5 billion. ??Both Edison and PG&E stockpiled massive debt when wholesale electricity prices soared. Price caps prevented them from passing along the entire cost of electricity to consumers. ??Since the Edison deal was announced however legislators have been critical of certain provisions suggesting that California consumers will receive little in return for relieving the utility of billions of dollars in debt. ??It's clear that the deal as is could well be problematic said Senate President Pro Tem John Burton D-San Francisco. This has to do with what's in the bill what's in it for the people of the state. ??Lawmakers initially believed they would have little ability to change the agreement and referred to it as a take it or leave it deal. ??In fact the memorandum of understanding itself says the deal can be nullified in the event any law is passed adopted or repealed ... (which) would materially impede or frustrate the ability of the Parties to effectuate all of the elements of the plan as a package. ??But in his meeting with Senate Democrats Davis indicated he may be willing to compromise. His goal he said is to keep Edison from following PG&E into bankruptcy. ??We still have some work to do Davis said. I think the appointment of a special Senate committee assuming that happens will let us work through the detail in an appropriate fashion. ??Burton said he has not decided whether to appoint a committee. ??Other senators came out of the meeting guardedly optimistic that they could compromise with the governor. ??It was obvious that there were concerns from members said Sen. Don Perata D-Alameda. He is open and ready to have the proposal perfected as it moves through the legislative process. ??Sen. Jackie Speier D-Hillsborough said she hopes to amend the deal to ensure power generators are penalized for over-charging the utilities and the state for electricity. ??The way it's presently crafted (generators) are being rewarded she said. They are getting a premium for selling electricity at a higher premium than ever conceived of by humankind. ??(Contact Emily Bazar and Kevin Yamamura of the Sacramento Bee in California at http://www.sacbee.com.)

Given the recent issues power plant development has had in Florida (big political fights that are going the wrong way) I was wondering if it made sense to bring together a meeting of all of Public Affairs and the deal team to analyze the implications of our development plans. My primary worry is that P/L under water could have severe ecological implications that are not being internalized into the transaction. I would like to try and arrange a meeting to (1) ensure Public Affairs coordination and (2) understand the deal impacts better. Please advise if I'm worrying for no good reason.

490,Re: Confidential --CFTC Chair,Hi Steve Folks love Newsome and I think he's very nice and appears to be very free market. Spears the other Republican appointee is not at all free market in my view. I would not like this to mentioned anywhere else but I have found that the farm reps on the Commission may sound deregulatory but are not and have been really troublesome without a good free market person on board. And there are no truly free market persons on board at the Commission (every single other agricultural rep that I worked with on the Commission were trouble even though they claimed to be deregulatory -- and they were far worse before I got there and after I left.) I visited with Newsome a day before Inauguration and I was appalled at what they were planning to do concerning agency structure -- that would have elevated the regulatory lawyers and diminished the role of the economists at the agency. Misguided and showed to me a lack of understanding of how organizational structures can affect what comes out of an agency. I am often at odds with the industry view regarding CFTC issues. I don't think the futures exchanges who have a lot of power necessarily are pro-competition and many of the non-exchange folks who lobby on CFTC issues are Washington or New York (Democrat - which is why they want to involve Ken at this level) lawyers who do not understand markets and who are more interested in being able to claim influence or impact. The CFTC is in awful shape -- the quality of staff is horrendous and the Commission is relying on some of the worst people for their policy work (same folks that Brooksley Born used same folks who have advocated more regulation of the OTC market for years). Many quality folks do not want the job as Chairman because it's been such a backwater. I am looking for some good folks. Have at least one person who would be good at that job. And it's not Newsome. Please do not share this information with the usual folks as they hate me anyway (I'm too free market and have argued against their fixes). Sorry for this scathing review but this is an important appointment. Wendy,"CFTC; Appointments; Regulation; Free Market

We hope to have agreed on the Q&A's by then and to send it out the announcement on Thursday. John To be sent to: All Enron Europe all employees in Japan all Global Markets and all VPs and up around the company Enron has established several wholesale businesses in Japan in the last year including Metals Power Plant Development (via our investment in EnCom) Coal LNG & Weather. We see significant opportunities in each of these businesses and we will continue to expand our presence in Japan in order to capture these opportunities. However while Japan continues to make progress towards a liberalized electricity market significant barriers to power trading remain under the current interim market structure. Until further tangible steps are taken to improve third party access for electricity in Japan we will suspend our power marketing efforts and focus on the significant opportunities that currently exist in our other wholesale businesses. [Any statement regarding our existing power sales commitment?] Once the necessary regulatory changes have been completed we expect to aggressively pursue Enron's traditional position as the leading buyer and seller of electricity in every deregulated market. We are making a number of organization changes in order to better align our resources with the opportunities in the Japanese market. [deleted text] Joe Hirl our President of Enron Japan will move to the Global Markets group and lead a team that will focus on developing all our Global Markets opportunities in Japan especially Weather Oil LNG Coal and Shipping. We expect to continue our general recruiting of Japanese nationals and as President of Enron Japan Joe will continue to provide the overall business leadership to both recruiting and the Analyst and Associate program in Japan. The Finance origination team headed by Jeremy Thirsk will continue to report to Joe and also move to Global Markets. Our power trading group led by Morton Erik Pettersen will transition into other roles around Enron. The Equity/FX/Interest rate team which is a part of Global Markets has two employees in the Tokyo office today and they expect to expand their efforts throughout the year. The EnCom group which is our power plant development business (with minority partners) and headed by Carey Sloan will continue its efforts in developing power plants in Japan. We are pleased with the progress we are making on a number of sites and EnCom will continue to report to the Enron Europe Office of the Chairman. Our Metals team headed by Kazunari Sugimoto will continue to report through Enron Metals in London. By May we expect Enron Credit to have two to three employees in Tokyo pursing the Credit Derivative business. These employees remain in Enron Credit  a part of Enron Europe. EBS has two employees headed by Jim Weisser and this team expects to expand by year end. The Industrial Markets team also expects to have two employees in the Tokyo office in the next couple of months. In the last seven months the commercial support services for Japan have been transitioned to London for support and this is not changing. Jane McBride heads the legal team and will continue to functionally report to Mark Evans General Counsel in London. The RAC function will continue to report to Ted Murphy head of RAC for Enron Europe. The Risk Management and Accounting team is headed by Jan-Erland Bekeng will continue to functionally report to Fernley Dyson in London. The IT HR Tax and real estate teams will also continue to functionally report to London. Nick O'Day who heads the Public Affairs group (Government & Regulatory Affairs and the Public Relations) in Japan will report to the Enron Europe Office of the Chair with a Public Relations functional reporting to Jackie Gentle in London and a Government Affairs functional reporting to Rick Shapiro in Houston. We anticipate that his team's efforts will be primarily directed to supporting the EnCom power plant development team but they will also continue to provide support for Global Markets EBS & Industrial Markets. We have already made considerable progress in breaking into the Japanese markets across a wide range of Enron businesses and we anticipate that this will provide significant profit growth for years to come. Through these current changes we can demonstrate our ability to be flexible and target our resources where they will realise the most immediate value for the company.,"Business; Japan; Enron; Organizational Changes

509,Fantastic Article in wash post on Refunds,- California Changes Stance on Refunds Two Sides Far Apart In Energy Talks By Peter Behr Washington Post Staff Writer Friday July 6 2001 Page E01 California officials have abruptly shifted tactics in their attempt to recover billions of dollars in alleged overcharges for electricity saying they may reduce their demands for huge refunds if generators renegotiate $43 billion in long-term electricity contracts that the state signed this year. Gov. Gray Davis (D) said part of the $8.9 billion in refunds the state is seeking could be offset by reductions in energy prices in the long-term contracts whose costs have become a growing political embarrassment for Davis. We've made suggestions we've offered various ways in which people could get us $8.9 billion Davis told the San Jose Mercury News in a report yesterday. You can renegotiate our existing contracts and save us money. However you want to do it it's just got to net out close to $8.9 billion. The new offer was introduced this week into the closed negotiations over a California settlement being conducted in Washington by Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Judge Curtis L. Wagner Jr. according to sources close to the negotiations. Yesterday Wagner said he may issue his own preliminary finding today on the amount of overcharges if California officials and the generators cannot reach a compromise. What I'm trying to do is get people in a settlement mood Wagner told reporters. In the event we're unable to do that [Friday] at some point I may offer a preliminary assessment. The settlement conference is set to conclude on Monday. Wagner FERC's chief administrative judge has been trying to push both sides toward a compromise that would resolve the huge energy pricing controversy. Mountainous energy prices have bankrupted California's largest utility drained billions of dollars out of the state treasury and put Davis at sword's point with generators that help keep the state's lights on. Last Friday Wagner rebuked Davis's chief representative Michael Kahn chairman of California Independent Grid Operator -- the state's power grid manager -- indicating that the state's demand for nearly $9 billion in refunds from power generators and marketers was too high sources said. Wagner's settlement conference which has involved more than 100 lawyers for all sides is closed to the public and media. Wagner complained last month that Kahn was following a political agenda and his lack of independence in the negotiations was such a joke that the parties might as well wear clown suits according to a Dow Jones report confirmed by sources close to the talks. But he has also criticized the generators and power marketers led by Reliant Energy Inc. Williams Energy Services Duke Energy and Southern Co. for failing to make serious settlement offers these sources said. The suppliers have offered to refund $600 million provided the state is able to call off various California lawsuits demanding far larger refunds sources said. Wagner's leverage is his ability to propose his own refund figure to FERC's commissioners. FERC has tentatively called for $124 million in refunds but now is taking a harder line on preventing a new escalation of California's electricity prices this summer and is likely to be receptive to a higher refund figure some energy analysts believe. Davis's tactical change offering to make the long-term contracts part of an overall settlement comes amid growing criticism of what the state will have to pay for energy under those deals. California's energy calamity stemmed in large part from its failed deregulation plan which relied heavily on short-term power purchases at volatile spot market prices. When energy costs shot upward last summer so did the state's electricity bills. In response Davis's aide S. David Freeman and his staff began negotiating long-term power contacts with suppliers. The $43 billion in deals signed so far would require the state to pay about $70 per hour for a megawatt of power for a large part of the electricity it will need over the next 10 years. That's well under the average of $250 per megawatt-hour that the state was paying at the beginning of this year but above current power prices -- and considerably higher than what electricity may cost in the next decade energy analysts say. A new agreement to lower those contract prices could relieve political pressure on Davis and focus settlement negotiations away from the state's controversial demand for the $8.9 billion refund. Davis will argue that reducing future power charges that his administration negotiated should count as a refund because the deals were reached under commercial duress according to sources close to Wagner's negotiations. Industry supporters say Davis's refund figure is impossible to justify. There's no benchmark for what a fair and reasonable price should be said Michael Zenger California director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates. The state's advocates counter that if FERC enforced a just and reasonable standard for power prices based on operating costs and a generous profit the overcharges by all sellers could easily reach the $9 billion figure. It's not rocket science but it does require the regulators to regulate said Frank Wolak a Stanford University economist who heads an oversight committee for the California grid. Those polar-opposite views have left both sides in Wagner's conference room billions of dollars apart as the talks approached their final weekend sources said.  2001 The Washington Post Company,"Energy; Refunds; California; Politics

510,Southeast RTO: Southerns Load,The Barton discussion draft says that FERC's hands would be tied and that they would have to approve a proposed RTO as to size and scope if the proposed RTO owns or has operational control over transmission facilities that serve at least 40000 MW of load. Southern's CEO testified in Congress recently that their load is over 35000. I assume the 40000 MW minimum would permit the SeTrans proposal to meet the proposed statutory minimum since it is Southern plus a few munis as I understand it. Is this correct? Who would know how many RTOs there would be if each were just over the 40000 MW minimum? I assume it is much more than 4-5 RTOs -- if so this is a good contrast to use in our Hill efforts.

513,Summary of Administration Comments on Bingaman Bill,I have read through the 19 pages of Administration comments on the Bingaman draft electricity bill released last month. Here are the main items in a quick bullet format so you have the flavor of them. Delete provision on federal jurisdiction over bundled/unbundled (they don't offer a reason). We of course agree for tactical reasons. Add a provision to authorize FERC to order wheeling in States that open retail markets. Add a provision to allow FERC to issue wheeling orders on its own motion based on an informal hearing rather than an adjudicatory hearing as under current law. Make it clear that the Federal Power Act does not affect the authority of a State to require retail competition (the comments say some utilities have tried to argue that the FPA prohibits states). The provision giving FERC power to order RTO participation should be deleted. The comments raise drafting question. The changes to the FERC merger review sections of the FPA should be limited. FERC lite should be extended only to state municipal utilities and cooperatives not the Federal utilities. The FERC should authority over the Federal transmission systems equivalent to FERC authority over public utilities (with special BPA rules). No need to legislate on market-based rates (we oppose the Bingaman language anyway so this is helpful). Interconnection language should be limited to transmission facilities not local distribution. No objection to streamlined reliability provision (this is good for us). Remedial measures for market power should be deleted. Administration to provide legislative language on federal transmission siting provisions which they want to retain. Not convinced there is a need for market transparency rules because FERC and DOE already have enough authority. Administration supports even tougher criminal penalties. Recordkeeping under PUHCA repeal should be clarified. Federal purchase requirement for renewable energy should be deleted. No objection to real-time pricing standard. Net metering should be limited to small residential renewable facilities. Do not support federal renewable portfolio standard (but could clarify state authority to adopt same).,"Energy Policy; FERC; Administration; Legislation

Depending on what that means it could seriously hamstring FERC's efforts for a 4-5 RTO model as sought and we support by not letting FERC change existing RTOs (particularly if that includes pending but not approved) to change. For example would the language under consideration block a Northeast RTO of PJM NY and NE since PJM is existing and NY has filed? What would be the rationale for such a serious limitation on FERC's authority? Thanks. ,"FERC; RTOs; Regulation

Price volatility is in the news like never before and our main product is price risk management. I know that the inquiries are up I hope EES and ENA can get some sales out of it. More utilities have been approaching TNPC EES and ENA about taking over their merchant functions. On the policy side we are working the issue on both a state and federal level. Whether this country does anything meaningful to deal with the current crisis comes donw to one person ... Linda Breathitt. Ken Lay spoke with Secy Richardson and Sen Schumer about proposing rulemaking initiatives to FERC. We are working the RTO process hard elsewhere in the country and coming up with messages to arm our remaining allies around the country. THis is the biggest time for us on this issue since the very beginnings in California and New Hampshire. In the current panic however we will be decimated if we are associated only with a move to keep price caps from going into effect (I saw your message to Mona). I am going to read the comments next but I start off thinking we need to avoid running headlong into the price cap movement we may be better off trying to co-opt the movement to get broader reform.

527,Ken Lay Mention At NRSC Reception Last Night,Last night I attended the National Republican Senatorial Committee's reception at Senator Frist's home in DC. (Frist is the NRSC chairman this cycle.) Enron including Jeff and Linda had been invited to the reception the purpose of which was to introduce ex-RNC chairman Haley Barbour as the NRSC's National Finance Chairman. Present were over a dozen Republican senators including Minority Leader Lott Whip Nickles and Sens. Kay Bailey Hutchison Bunning (KY) Fitzgerald (IL) Cochran (MS) Inhofe (OK) Bond (MO) Crapo (ID) Voinovich (OH) Allen (VA) and Chafee (RI). The news from our perspective is that Haley Barbour singled out Ken Lay for praise as the first person to step to the plate and agree to help with their new Majority Makers program. This is the effort that Barbour will head up to raise $21 million for this election cycle by concentrating on events outside DC that would target businesses and business leaders without a DC presence. Barbour said that Ken had agreed to organize and chair a Houston fundraiser to raise $1 million toward the $21 million total. Ken was the first name he mentioned. The only others were the DeVos family in Michigan and Julie Finley a major GOP fundraiser based in DC. Needless to say I was suddenly quite popular after Haley made his remarks to the assembled group. Haley said he looked forward to working with us on this project. As you know from a previous e-mail Pat Shortridge had earlier seen our mutual friend Mitch Bainwol the executive director of the NRSC who had told Pat at lunch last week that Haley had spoken with Ken but last night was the first I had heard a dollar figure -- and a big one at that -- linked to the effort. While it was not stated I assume from the location and size of the event's goal that the President would be involved (but this is only an educated assumption on my part). Later I saw Karen Hughes of the White House staff but I do not think she was present when Haley made his comments.,"Politics; Republican Party; Fundraising; Ken Lay; Enron

In the Senate: The Senate bill 78XX is with about 90% likelihood going to be voted out of the Senate tonight---without a vote having taking place in any committee. Burton announced during one of the two informational hearings that this is it despite the view of just about everyone who appeared before the committees the bill likely won't prevent Edison from going bankrupt. The key features of the bill are: Banks and QFs get paid in full. Edison shareholders would be responsible for debts owed to suppliers No direct access. There are conflicting reports about whether the Senate will take up the bill tomorrow de-linking the bonds from the DWR contracts and whether the Republicans will go along with it. In the Assembly: The Committee is hearing the Wright and Hertzberg bills as we speak with Hertzberg's the likely winner. That bill now provides for Direct Access under certain conditions (the amendments describing the conditions were faxed today). We're attempting to get the July 12 date changed to the effective date of the bill or later. The Assembly likely won't vote the Hertzberg bill out until tomorrow at the earliest. The Problem: The Assembly and Senate bills are diametrically opposed in the way each approaches the problem---in short the bills are two ships passing in the night. The Democratic leaders (Governor Hertzberg Burton) aren't talking and Burton hasn't expressed any interest in talking---to anybody. The likely outcome given the circumstances: Burton says he's done what he needs to do (i.e. passed out a fair bill) the Assembly and Senate can't agree they finish the budget time runs out they leave Friday and Edison's left twisting. That said there's still a chance that the Governor could call Burton and sit down with Burton and Hertzberg and work something out by Friday or begin talking and postpone the recess until they get it worked out. But given Burton the chance of that happening seems very slim. In short little has changed since yesterday. Best Jeff,"California Energy Crisis; Politics; Legislation

Gray Davis reported the Register yesterday. Even= =20 that $1 billion amount might be balanced by the amount the state still owes= =20 the power producers.=20 To suggest workable and market-oriented solutions to the California=20 electricity crisis. Judge Curtis Wagner's recommendation will be taken up by the Federal Energy= =20 Regulatory Commission which is being petitioned for the money by the state= =20 of California.=20 Because the judge's words will bolster FERC's apparent desire not to grant= =20 the refunds the state probably will go to court where the matter could = be=20 stuck for years. In the long term this may indicate that competitive electricity has a=20 future even in California but not thanks to the state Robert Michaels a= =20 professor of economics at Cal State Fullerton told us.

As my request has nothing to do with the people in this office or the group they are wonderful I've been with Enron since '97 and I relocated up to Connecticut to work with the New Power Company when I thought that the Enron employees would stay Enron employees. Afterwards of course we all were changed to NewPower employees. After a couple of months I made the move back to Enron and went to the New York office and work with the Enron Metals group here at 53rd street. (It was never my intention to leave Enron) Since the bombing I feel very displaced and my husband and I would really like to come back to Houston and was wondering if you could help me. I was on the trading floor working with Dave Delainey's group when he was in ENA and also was the Exec Secretary/Coordinator with the MWB group in George Warsoff's group. I would appreciate it very much if you were able to assist/guide me.

564,Re: HP -- confidential internal document,Good plan. I agree re SJ. She is on the ball. mh Patrick Tucker 12/14/00 04:28 PM To: Matt Harris/Enron Communications@Enron Communications cc: Dale Clark/Enron Communications@Enron Communications Subject: Re: HP -- confidential internal document I agree. Sarah-Joy and I had a detailed follow-on conversation today about this topic and we're in agreement as to how things can move forward. I'd definitely like to have Bill rejoin our conversation with our new overall commercial contact at HP whose name Greg Pyle and Bill Lovejoy will supply in the very near future. I understand that Peter Goebel was quite clear with HP in today's meetings regarding the imminent nature of his wireless decision the breadth of vendors with whom he could conceivably do business and the fact that the wireless deal and the Enron sell side are inextricably linked. Sarah-Joy mentioned that Gerry has not been present in the more recent conversations which we're taking to indicate that Bill and Greg understand that his focus was different than ours. Sarah-Joy has brought immense focus and organization to this process. I have certainly found her involvement invaluable. Patrick Matt Harris 12/14/00 10:51 AM To: Sarah-Joy Hunter/NA/Enron@ENRON cc: Dale Clark/Enron Communications@Enron Communications Jennifer Medcalf/NA/Enron@Enron Patrick Tucker/Enron Communications@Enron Communications Peter Goebel/NA/Enron@Enron Subject: Re: HP -- confidential internal document This is an excellent update. Thanks for putting this together. Dale/Patrick - lets regroup on how we want to move this onward. Seems like SJ's suggestion of our spending more time with Bill Dwyer is a good one. Thanks Matt Sarah-Joy Hunter@ENRON 12/12/00 02:42 PM To: Matt Harris/Enron Communications@Enron Communications cc: Patrick Tucker/Enron Communications@Enron Communications Peter Goebel/NA/Enron@Enron Dale Clark/Enron Communications@Enron Communications Jennifer Medcalf/NA/Enron@Enron Subject: HP -- confidential internal document Matt: As GSS Business Development transitions the HP relationship for broadband to your team there are several issues I wanted to clarify in terms of how the relationship has been developed and who the contacts have been to date. Additionally I outlined the discussion points/action items from this morning's meeting you held with Jennifer Medcalf and myself. Per your request the HP presentation complete with a listing of HP's business partners was e-mailed to you this morning. HP contacts to date: Bill Lovejoy Western Gulf Area Sales Manager Houston TX #(713)-439-5587 (Gerry Cashiola's boss) Gerry Cashiola sales representative Houston TX #(713)-439-5555 (To date HP person coordinating the relationship--seeking a short term play) Greg Pyle Solution Control Manager Southeast Region Austin TX (#(512)-257-5735 (Pyle has been playing the business developer role but continues to defer leadership of the process to Gerry Cashiola) Daniel Morgridge Manager of Internet - E-Services long term alliances Austin TX #(512)-257-5736 (Interested in E-services/wireless longer term alliances) Bill Dwyer Chief Architect e-Services Solutions Cupertino CA #(408)-447-5240 (To date clearly the most knowledgeable person on HP's business propositions strong technical financial background to craft value propositions. Gerry Cashiola and Greg Pyle deferred to his judgement in the 11/16th meeting) Matt On November 10th GSS Business Development took HP through a tour of Enron's trading floor the gas control center and the peaking power plant unit center on the trading floor. This tour was one meeting amongst several held in October and November to provide HP a full overview of Enron's products and services and introduce them to appropriate contacts at Enron (EBS GSS buy side -- Peter Goebel). On November 16th GSS Business Development Patrick Tucker and Dale Clark outlined 3 possible EBS/HP focus areas -- connectivity storage and wireless. Three EBS action items were defined in that meeting: 1) HP was to provide an HP contact on connectivity (to date Gerry Cashiola has stalled on providing this). Sarah-Joy will continue to pursue this information and get a sense from Gerry Cashiola of what he means by short term opportunity. What is HP's time horizon for short term? 2) EBS and GSS/BD was to facilitate a conference call on Storage with Ravi to explore size and potential scope of opportunity (completed 12/8) 3) GSS/BD was to facilitate a conference call with Peter Goebel GSS IT Sourcing Portfolio Leader (set for 12/14) In conversations with you Jennifer Medcalf and myself this morning several decisions on forward-looking strategy with HP/EBS were confirmed: Gerry Cashiola has been unable to take control of the process. More importantly despite numerous visits to Enron in which he has had overviews of Enron's products and services met with Peter Goebel and his team on the GSS buy side and participated in an Experience Enron tour Gerry has been unable to define an HP business proposition. The coordination between Cashiola (short term initiative) Morgridge (long term 12-24 months) has remained unorganized. These initiatives need to be developed separately. Clearly the conversations with HP need to be elevated to a more senior level so EBS can work with HP decision makers who can move the relationship forward at a strategic level. As the relationship is developed at this strategic level shorter term opportunities will crop up along the way. But Gerry's short term plans will not be the focus of the EBS/HP relationship rather a by-product. To facilitate this process of elevating the relationship Jennifer Medcalf and I are following up with Bill Lovejoy and Greg Pyle. Lovejoy's boss is Dan Sytsma VP of HP's America's Central Region. In the conference call Thursday 12/14 with Peter Goebel and HP regarding wireless initiatives Peter will support the GSS/BD push for the HP/EBS initiative by reiterating the following two points: a) Enron is already an HP customer the onus is on HP to move forward on the process of building a strategic relationship (IBM and Lexmark are only some of the HP competitors who could push them out of the running) b) HP's ability to bring the right people to the table will influence HP's business relationship process with Enron Patrick Tucker and Dale Clark could build their relationship with Bill Dwyer Chief Architect e-Services Solutions (met at the meeting 11/16) in the near term. Perhaps plan a visit to Cupertino California to see Dwyer in person. We look forward to continuing close collaboration with your team on this and other opportunities.

Donnelly could lead to a= =20 mass exodus by hundreds of small energy producers that have been selling=20 power to the state's financially troubled utilities for months without=20 getting paid. ?????At the same time it may have staved off plans by a group of the small= =20 generators to send Edison into involuntary bankruptcy as early as today. ?????In Sacramento energy legislation pushed by Gov. Gray Davis passed in= =20 the state Senate but foundered in the Assembly. The measure was intended to= =20 ensure that the state gets repaid for the electricity that it has been buyi= ng=20 on behalf of Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric which say they lack the cas= h=20 and credit to purchase power. The bill also was supposed to guarantee that= =20 the small alternative energy producers--which together provide nearly a=20 third of the state's power--get paid. But Assembly Republicans opposed it= =20 saying it hadn't been given sufficient scrutiny. ?????The impact of the small producers was made clear in Imperial County= =20 where Edison's failure to pay CalEnergy the county's biggest property=20 taxpayer had outsize implications. CalEnergy had put county officials on= =20 notice that it was about to miss a $3.8-million property tax payment. The= =20 uncertainty had prompted the tiny Calipatria Unified School District to=20 postpone a bond issue for badly needed school repairs. ?????Among CalEnergy Chairman David Sokol's first acts after the judge's=20 ruling Thursday was to promise Imperial County Supervisor Wally J. Leimgrub= er=20 that the company would pay its property taxes on time. ?????That is great news Leimgruber said. ?????Within hours of its court victory CalEnergy had stopped transmitting= =20 geothermal power to Edison and begun selling it to El Paso Energy a=20 marketing company that purchased the energy at prevailing rates and resold = it=20 on the spot market. ?????Some of the more than 700 other small energy producers in the state sa= id=20 they were considering similar action against Edison and Pacific Gas &=20 Electric. ?????We absolutely need the right to sell to third parties said Dean=20 Vanech president of Delta Power a New Jersey company that owns five small= =20 gas-fired plants in California and is owed tens of millions of dollars by= =20 Edison. ?????Sokol praised the Imperial County judge and said his company simply=20 wanted the authority to sell its power to a credit-worthy company that in= =20 fact pays for the power. ?????An Edison spokesman said the company was disappointed with the ruling= =20 but sympathized with CalEnergy and other small producers because=20 California's power crisis has placed [them] in financial distress just as= =20 it has placed utilities in financial distress. ?????Edison expressed concern that the ruling would prompt CalEnergy and=20 other small producers to sell their power out of state. Sokol said CalEnerg= y=20 had specifically told El Paso Energy that it hoped its power would remain i= n=20 California but if someone wants to pay a higher price out of state we=20 can't stop them. ?????Sokol said that Edison still owes CalEnergy $140 million and that the= =20 company--along with seven other small producers--had been prepared to file = a=20 petition in federal bankruptcy court in Los Angeles today forcing the utili= ty=20 into involuntary bankruptcy. He said his company no longer intends to do so= =20 and he believed--but wasn't certain--that the other companies would shelve= =20 their plans. ?????Edison filed papers Thursday with the federal Securities and Exchange= =20 Commission showing that it owed $840 million to various small electricity= =20 producers many of which rely on renewable energy sources such as geotherma= l=20 steam solar energy or wind. ?????The alternative energy producers--and utilities--strenuously objected = to=20 the legislation considered in Sacramento on Thursday. The bill spelling ou= t=20 how the utilities are to pay the state and the small producers passed the= =20 Senate on a 27-9 vote the exact two-thirds margin required. But it stalled= =20 in the Assembly on a 46-23 party-line vote well short of two-thirds. ?????When I was a citizen back in Lancaster I heard these stories about= =20 pieces of legislation that were cooked up late at night that . . . were cu= t=20 and pasted together and were rammed through by the Legislature Assemblyma= n=20 George Runner (R-Lancaster) said.

It is a very simple question: Dollars= =20 going out cannot be greater than dollars coming in. ?????The bill AB 8X combined several proposals.

575,RE: Cal PUC Subpoenas - confidential attorney client communicatio n,Mike Richard and Gary: What I was suggesting was that we would produce the limited items that we are proposing under the terms of the existing protective order (which are inadequate but we are not giving up any of the crown jewels at this point) while conditioning our production on two points first that we reserve the right to seek stronger protection in the order (a la Williams' motion) for any subsequent materials we do agree to produce or which are compelled to be produced and two that the materials we are currently producing which are entitled to confidentiality (the trading data at a minimum) shall be subject to the most stringent protective order which the Commission issues in this proceeding i.e. we get the benefit of any additional protections Williams can secure. I only suggest this so we can stay out of the limelight by not being one of the bad guy generators who are actively taking on the protective order when we know that at least four generators are producing nothing until their motion is resolved and one marketer (Coral/Shell Energy) has refused to produce transactional data and has objected to most of the document request. I have also recently learned that Calpine has gotten an extension until Oct. 13 and will try to delay and hold off producing much data. I will get getting a copy of Coral's objections to the commission shortly. Mike Day ,"Legal; Confidentiality; Cal PUC

Wood's two-day hearing on Wholesale Markets which concluded today (8/24) in San Diego. Three Commissioner's were present (Wood Lynch and Neeper) with Duque and Bilas participating by phone. Administrative Law Judge Wetzel was present and a transcript was taken. The quasi-legislative hearing was the beginning of a record developed for the investigation into the workings of wholesale/retail markets. This session focused on Wholesale markets. There will be subsequent sessions on retail issues market structure and other related issues in the future. My conclusion from this session is that Wood is looking for support for increasing regulatory intervention in the market. Dan Larcamp Director of the Office of markets Tariffs and Rates FERC was present. He relayed FERC's concern of this matter and a desire to hold hearings in San Diego. He also relayed that Hoecker held a press conference announcing the opening of a 206 investigative proceeding into the operation of the wholesale markets in California which carried with it refund authority. The format of the hearing was to respond to pre-filed questions developed by Wood/Lynch. Each member of the panel would respond to the questions and any questions posed by the Commissioners the Judge or the CPUC Attorney. No questions were posed by members of the audience. Yesterday's panel of academics were comprised of: 1. Dr. Timothy Duane-UC Berkley 2. Dr. William Hogan-Harvard 3. Dr. Frank Wolak-Stanford (ISO Market Surveillance Committee) 4. David Marcus-Energy Consultant for the Coaltion of Utility Employees 5. Dr. Gene Coyle 6. Dr. Jean-Michel Glachant Universite Paris I Pantheon Sorbonne The panel was asked to speak as individuals and not on behalf of any institutions they may represent. While the purpose of the panel seemed to be to determine that market power was being exercised and that prices were too high and therefore not just and reasonable the panelist stopped short of blaming generators and market participants in behaving illegally. The concensus generally was that market power did exist at various times but the mere existence did not constitute bad behavior. None with the exception of Dr. Wolak who is in the process of doing a study using recent data as part of his role for the Market Surveillance Committee had done a study. There was some discussion though not much of the monopsony power of the utilities. I think ultimately the group conceded that scarcity of supply amplified concerns about the exercise of market power as even the increase in gas costs did not fully explain the recent spikes. Wolak believes that encourage utilities to enter into forward purchases will reduce the exercise of real-time market power. Hogan seemed to be there with Sempra's interests in mind. He continued to promote expansion of the ISO's abilities to dispatch load as well as maintain system reliability. There was alot of discussion about forward purchase ability for utilities so as to be less subject to volatile market prices. The concerns were also discussed about the appropriateness of a distribution utility making purchasing decisions on behalf of its customers. This included discussion of separation of these functions and the default provider role. Most everyone agreed that rolling back to a regulated market was not feasible without raising other major and serious concerns however there seemed to be support for some interim measures where cost-of-service regulation may be a good idea and that was during peak periods. All agreed that a demand response and price signals are important in the long-run although not to the extent currently experienced in San Diego. Today's panel included representatives from SDG&E SCE and PG&E TURN UCAN and ORA. While yesterday's panel maintained objectivity as to whether or not generators were exercising market power to the detriment of the system today's panel made no bones about the generators being to blame. SCE/PG&E indicated their need for relief for recovery of market costs in excess of the rate freeze. SDG&E was still on the hot seat for their inaction in hedging any of their supply. SDG&E brought up their failed PBR proposal and ORA and UCAN thought that that may be one way to incent the utility to be more responsible with their purchases. UCAN discussed the Governor's direction and the potential for putting rate caps into affect for residential and small commercial. He mentioned that C&I customers are experience difficulties as well. TURN raised the need for cost-based bid caps and cost-based peaking contracts. Mike Florio TURN urged against any further divestitute of assets and alleged market concentration on those assets that had been divested. In fact TURN urged the Commission to seek legislation to clarify the Commission's authority to order retention of assets. Neeper urged that part of the solution should be changing the current requirement to use the PX as the only authorized exchange although TURN disagreed.

Good new - The Williamson Act passed the Senate 34-1 It should be heard at the assembly Saturday or Monday if it is not redirected to a Committee hearing. 2. There was a long meeting with Ducheny with regards to AB 970. The enviro's boycotted they want to draft a bill with Keeley. Labor was obstructionist - they wanted to gut all the expediting siting language with regards to all facilities except for the peaking plants. Rate Cap related bills 1. The Edison Language on Rate Stabilization may not go anywhere. Edison has not found an author because of the efforts of Enron and others lobbying against it. Furthermore there are signs that Gov. Davis opposes it. 2. The Governor's office has issued a proposed language for a rate cap bill. The language however is not available as of yet. It may be released today or tomorrow. SDG&E has shown concerns over the content of the bill. They seem to think that it is worse than initially proposed by the Governor in his press release. The bill includes retroactive rate caps through 6/1/00. The rate cap could reflect Wood's rate cap proposal (6.5 cts cap on the energy component The bill does not specify who or how the costs associated with the cap will be recovered. (The reasoning is that UDCs will be more cautious in their procurement if there is uncertainty on who is responsible for the costs.) All of this is speculative. We hope to see the actual language soon. 3. Enron has been working with the Republican leadership to promote a rate cap proposal similar to the amended language we have proposed for AB2290. The bill focuses only on SDG&E customers and our major principals are the following. The Interim Rate Cap should be limited to residential and small commercial customers plus specific institutions that have a significant public role such as schools and hospitals. The Interim Rate Cap should be limited to the period ending December 31 2001. The Interim Rate Cap must be structured so that any undercollection is eventually recovered from the same customers who benefit from the lower rates provided by the rate cap.,"Energy; Legislation; California; Utilities

Feedback from two exit interviews from voluntary terminations in regard to Tom is as follows: was treated as inferior by my manager was lied to and insulted by my supervisor Tom berates employees in front of others and blames underlings for his mistakes. Additionally he second guessed every position I put on sold me out of positions (which turned out good) and used all our allocated VAR for his own benefit. Tom has a reputation for not representing employees well in the end of year review process. I found this to be the case as well. Tom is difficult to communicate with Additionally we had an incident w/ an employee when Tom offered her an employment agreement. She felt that she was being forced to sign the agreement When she declined the agreement and turned in resignation she said that Tom said he would make it difficult for her to leave She said that she felt threatened by Tom Her boy friend called Tom and threatened him As a result Legal asked Tom not to have further contact with the employee.,"Human Resources; Employment; Confidential Information

However EBS is doing tactical competitive analysis and market research.

I strongly believe that the public hit we will take will be far greater than our actual out-of-pocket losses. We will be crucified by the public media consumer groups legislators governor attorney general etc. and this action will reaffirm our reputation of packing up and leaving when it's not in our interest. The impact of this action would be exacerbated since it is on the heels of UC/CSU. I would also argue that this hurts our national dereg efforts. If we're advocating that competition and choice benefits consumers and then we turn around and pull out of a market and abandon customers when we're not profiting we'll kill any chances we have of ever serving retail customers in California -- or in any other state. We look foolish advocating for direct access when we're not willing to serve our existing -- let alone future customers What about a preemptive strike that engages these 16000 customers to weigh in on direct access -- i.e. a letter that says Enron may be forced to cancel its contract -- call/write/send the enclosed postcard to your legislator and tell them you want to keep your right to choose your energy service provider. Our credibility is on the line. Before we take this action we need to be cognizant of all the long-range strategic implications and we need to seriously weigh the negative impact this will have on our corporate reputation on our legislative abilities and on our commercial success going forward. kd James D Steffes 04/12/2001 09:05 PM To: Jeff Dasovich/NA/Enron@Enron Paul Kaufman/PDX/ECT@ECT Sandra McCubbin/NA/Enron@Enron Richard Shapiro/NA/Enron@Enron Janel Guerrero/Corp/Enron@Enron Mark Palmer/Corp/Enron@ENRON Karen Denne/Corp/Enron@ENRON Susan J Mara/NA/Enron Peggy Mahoney/HOU/EES@EES Harry Kingerski/NA/Enron@Enron cc: Dan Leff/HOU/EES@EES Subject: CONFIDENTIAL - Residential in CA In the meeting today no decision was made about what to do with Enron's 16000 residential customers. Each of the contracts gives a basic 30 day out right to Enron. That being said I think that we have a short window to push for DA before any public action impacts us in Sacramento. I realize that the ultimate action (which I think is inevitable) makes it harder for our advocacy on DA but real $ are flowing out of the company. EES will give us notice when a decision is reached.

612,Report on POWER Conference,I attended the U.C. Berkeley POWER (Program on Workable Energy Regulation) Conference on March 16. Here is a brief report on the relevant parts. Notably the Lieff Cabreser duo of Bill Bernstein and Barry Himmelstein were there listening carefully. The program consisted of the presentation of 8 economic studies followed by comments from two discussants followed by audience questions/comments. The following is a list of the papers and the discussants who presented with slides taken from the website of the U.C. Energy Institute You can click on this to see the slides in PDF format. The papers in green are not particularly relevant for our purposes and I won't say more about them beyond the note in brackets. The presenter's name is in bold. Bidding Asymmetries in Multi-Unit Auctions: Implications of Bid Function Equilibria in the British Spot Market for Electricity by Greg Crawford Duke University Joe Crespo NERA and Helen Tauchen University of North Carolina Pricing and Firm Conduct in California's Deregulated Electricity Market by Steve Puller UC Berkeley Discussion by Anjali Sheffrin California Independent System Operator Identification and Estimation of Cost Functions Using Observed Bid Data: An Application to Electricity Markets by Frank Wolak Stanford University [A paper about economic tools to study power markets.] Forward Contracts and the Curse of Market Power by Jeffrey Lien  University of Maryland The Impact of Retail Rate Deregulation on Electricity Consumption in San Diego by James Bushnell and Erin Mansur UC Berkeley [This looks at whether consumption declined with price increases. Not much.] Consumption and Home Energy Costs: How Prevalent is the 'Heat or Eat' Decision? by Julie Berry Cullen University of Michigan Leora Friedberg University of Virginia and Catherin Wolfram UC Berkeley [A macro study on how consumers change overall spending patterns when they have to shell out more $$ for power.] A Quantitative Analysis of Pricing Behavior in California's Wholesale Electricity Market During Summer 2000 by Paul Joskow MIT and Edward Kahn Analysis Group Electricity Restructuring and the Cost of Pollution Reduction by Dallas Burtraw Karen Palmer Ranjit Bharvirkar and Anthony Paul Resources for the Future Before I discuss the specific papers and presenters one big picture point needs to be made. There was an unchallenged consensus at this conference that the generators have exercised market power to the tune of billions of dollars. The focus was on how and how much not whether. The good news is that I heard no evidence supporting any collusion theory the thought was that generators are making independent output and pricing decisions knowing they could influence the market price given the auction rules and the completely inelastic demand. On the other hand I would have to say that the economic work on the tacit collusion hypothesis in incomplete at best. The bad news is that the scale of potential overcharges is pretty staggering -- >$5 billion. The plaintiffs will be able to put together quite a damage study. Crespo Bidding Asymmetries in UK: This is a marginally relevant paper examining whether bidders in the UK electricity auction markets behaved in a leader-follower mode i.e. asymmetrically. Crespo's model shows that in a uniform price-setting auction with clearing price rules a price setter will emerge and take all prices above marginal cost. Thus above marginal cost pricing does not require coordination. Crespo (from NERA) appeared knowledgeable but is not an inspiring speaker. His paper also got roughed up a bit in the audience questioning segment. Puller Pricing and Firm Conduct in California's Deregulated Electricity Market: This is a very relevant paper as it tries to determine whether market power (presumably) exercised in California was static or dynamic meaning the product of individual firm decisionmaking (static) or tacit collusion (dynamic). The period studied was 4/98 to 12/99. Puller found evidence of static market power consistent with so-called Cournot pricing. This theory posits that in an oligopoly firms will take their rivals' observed price/output decisions as a given and decide how to maximize profitability given that behavior. He then tried to determine whether any dynamic games were occurring meaning a game where firms recognize their interdependence and try to follow a supergame trigger strategy in which firms try to induce favorable responses from rivals. It's quite complicated how he goes about this but fundamentally he tries to correlate observed output decisions with how a firm at that time might have expected a change in its behavior to affect its future share of the market. With this methodology Puller finds what he called weak evidence of forward-looking dynamic pricing for a brief time in 1998 but not otherwise. My impression was that the evidence for 1998 was very weak and the logic used to arrive at this conclusion was also weak. Puller then went at this a second time with a theory that attempts to determine what a firm's supply function would look like if it was exercising static and dynamic market power and then comparing this to an estimate of that firm's actual supply function. I found this even more speculative than the first theory. Nonetheless the results are basically the same: evidence of static but not dynamic market power. Puller took a lot of heat for the methodology of this paper during the questioning segment. He's not a dynamic speaker and does not appear to me to be a strong expert candidate. Anjali Sheffrin's commentary was very important. She is the Director of Market Analysis for CAISO. After general comments on Crespo and Puller she launched in to a discussion of whether their models explained the California experience. This turned out to be a preview of the CAISO FERC filing of last week in which they allege $5.5 billion in market power-related overcharges from May 200 to Feb. 2001. That filing and Sheffrin's report follow. They are essential reading. Sheffrin maintains that it was the absence of imports during this period that left the market power of the California generators unchecked. This permitted the in-state generators to engage in either economic or physical withholding of power. (Economic withholding is bidding a higher-than-needed supply curve physical withholding is cutting output at the plant.) Her study was intended to (1) Identify individual firms engaging in market power activity and (2) Analyze how each firms' actions set market clearing prices. She utilized full bidding data in CA ISO real time market for each hour between May and Nov 2000 defined and categorized bidding patterns and identified economic or physical withholding and then calculated bid-cost mark-up and a monopoly rent. She found what she claimed was strong evidence of both types of withholding but that economic withholding is the dominant bidding pattern used by the five large California generators. While Sheffrin's study does not name names it claims that most of the five in-state suppliers and many of the [16] large importers displayed bidding patterns which were consistent with the exercise of market power. Bernstein and Himmelstein were positively gleeful during this presentation. On the question of collusion Sheffrin's study is not terribly illuminating. She maintains that the dominant bidding pattern is consistent with two characteristics of a supply function equilibrium model of oligopolist pricing. I take that to mean Cournot which is a static non-collusive model. However when you read her study you'll see the picture is not entirely clear. Lien The Curse of Market Power: This is only marginally relevant for us as its thesis is that forward-looking supply contracts are better for both producers and society. Everyone seemed to agree -- and were confused why we needed a paper to prove it. Lien (U. Md.) is young and not expert material. Joskow and Kahn: (paper) (Kahn's slides). I'm sure many of you have already read this everyone should. Prepared for SoCal Edison it contends that 4 in-state generators (Reliant Dynegy AES/Williams and Southern/Mirant) exercised market power by withholding capacity during the summer or 2000. J&K use publicly available data on loads market prices and generation to (a) quantify combined effects of market fundamentals on market prices (b) calculate price gap (difference between actual prices and competitive market benchmarks) (c) account for quantify effects of ISO's ancillary services requirements and forced outages and then (d) calculate the output gap for high priced hours meaning the difference between observed and maximum profitable levels of generation. They conclude that prices were far in excess of the competitive benchmark and that the 4 in-state generators could have produced more power at competitive prices but chose not to. Hence market power was exercised. Kahn the Analysis Group economist who presented is a very colorful and rather undisciplined advocate of his position. He threw around allegations of conspiracy rather casually but mostly to be funny. I couldn't tell whether he believed his study proved that I don't think it even speaks to it. But Bernstein and Himmelstein applauded him when he finished grinning ear to ear. Severin Borenstein UC Berkeley and the conference director was supposed to comment on J&K but hardly did. He said that the generators would have been stupid not to exercise market power given the supply/demand conditions and the market rules and argued that permitting long term contracts and requiring real-time residential pricing were the solutions to all of this. Borenstein was the best expert material I saw at this conference and the fact he took a pass on the details of the J&K paper is puzzling to me. It made me wonder whether he already has a horse in this race or perhaps is trying to stay above it all. Hope this is useful. Regards Dan Daniel M.

Mime-Version: 1.0 Content-Type: text/plain charset=us-ascii Content-Disposition: inline IS TRADING AN INSIDER'S GAME? Buying selling of electricity is a growth business but some say deck is stacked against consumers By Craig D. Rose STAFF WRITER June 6 2001 While Californians decry deregulation's failure to deliver a competitive market electricity wholesalers have quietly developed a vast and rapidly growing business of buying and selling power among themselves. The deals take place on high-tech trading floors in Houston and elsewhere around the country as well as on Internet-based trading systems. Some experts say this electricity trading is a key mechanism for raising consumer power prices yet it's largely unregulated. Electricity trading is like buying stock -- when you have ability to change the stock price said Frank Wolak a Stanford University economics professor and member of the state grid operator's market surveillance group. Energy companies say the buying and selling of contracts to deliver power provides risk management allowing plant owners to presell their electricity lock in prices and avoid fluctuations. The rough and tumble of the free market they add is the most efficient means of allocating a resource like electricity. But industry critics say trading is far from a competitive market paradigm. In their view it's a means of communication -- a way for energy insiders to collude and raise prices under the guise of competition. To be sure the trading arms of major energy companies have emerged as stars in an industry where profit surges of 300 percent or 400 percent are not uncommon. The transactions shrouded in secrecy can leave ownership of a critical commodity in unknown hands. Consider the case of power generated by AES Corp.'s California plants. In 1998 AES made a bold move. Immediately after purchasing power plants that gave it control of 10 percent of the state's electric generating capacity the company sold the output from its plants for the next 20 years to Williams Cos. Williams did not sit on this treasure trove of electrons. The Tulsa Okla. company soon sold 80 percent of what it bought. It is difficult to say who owns that power now. Some might be owned by Sempra Trading a sister company of SDG&E. Or some could be owned by Enron Corp. the nation's biggest electricity trader. A spokeswoman for Williams conceded that Williams itself may have repurchased some of the electricity it sold earlier. But trading companies closely guard their positions. This much can be said with certainty: Electricity that AES sold for less than 5 cents per kilowatt-hour to Williams changed hands perhaps 10 times in the wholesale market and emerged at times in recent months with a price tag for consumers that was 300 percent higher. Williams' trading profits increased by 523 percent in the first quarter this year. Advance sales All this buying and selling creates curious confluences. In their attempt to deflect criticism over high prices generating companies such as Duke Energy -- operator of the South Bay Power Plant in Chula and others in the state -- frequently note that they sell most of their electricity far in advance. But they acknowledge less often that their trading units may also be buying power which could boost the company's electricity inventory. Duke was the fourth biggest electricity trader last year and cited its trading activity as a prime contributor to its wholesale business profits which soared 324 percent in the first quarter to $348 million. It is a company's power traders who frequently direct plant operators to increase or decrease the generation of power in response to market conditions. Energy companies have little option but to turn to trading for profits. One of the better kept secrets of electrical deregulation and its promise of competition is that there is remarkably little competition in the production side of the business. For one thing electricity is a commodity power from one company is indistinguishable from that generated by others. More important nearly all modern plants generate power from turbines built by a handful of manufacturers. The result? Modern plants owned by different companies produce power at nearly identical cost. The cost of power produced by modern plants is all within a mil (one-thousandth of a dollar) said Michael Peevey an adviser to Gov. Gray Davis and former president of Southern California Edison. So the extraction of profit in the electricity business relies much more on trading. Traders' profits rise when prices are volatile -- plunging or even better rising sharply. Little regulation But despite the obvious temptation to manipulate the market the burgeoning electricity trading business has remained largely unregulated. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission does require quarterly filings from energy traders but these often provide incomplete information or at least little that has been of concern to FERC. In fact although the trading of electricity grew more than a hundredfold from 1996 to 2000 FERC has taken no major enforcement action against a trader. After the onset of the California crisis last year FERC has acted once. That was against Williams which agreed to pay $8 million without admitting guilt to resolve an allegation that it withheld supply to pump up prices. FERC's record of enforcement in the area of power trading stands in contrast to a long list of enforcement actions within other markets taken by the Securities Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. FERC has recently added staff to its market oversight operations. But William Massey a FERC commissioner says the agency's effort is still inadequate. Electricity can be flipped stripped and chopped up Massey said. It's an extraordinarily complicated market. The sophisticated marketers and traders have simply moved past us. We're kind of horse and buggy in our approach and they're out there in rocket ships flying around ... The problem is that sophisticated traders don't necessarily produce reasonable prices. They produce profits. Before deregulation electricity trading was a low-key affair. Regulated utilities dealt power back and forth on a reciprocal basis to fill electricity shortfalls in their control areas. There was little trading for profit until the mid-1990s after federal legislation and FERC rulings opened the market. Major traders include large energy companies sister companies of California's major utilities and Wall Street firms. Market volatility In many ways the trading of power is similar to that of other commodities. But there are important differences. Because it cannot be stored and its use is so fundamental the price of electricity is the most volatile of all. When supplies are tight a single supplier can rapidly raise prices to budget-busting levels as evidenced by Duke Energy's recent admission that it charged California nearly $4000 for a megawatt-hour of power a quantity that probably sold hours earlier for one-tenth of that sum or less. Wolak the Stanford economist and state Sen. Joseph Dunn D-Garden Grove who is investigating the state power market say trading allows companies to collude under the guise of competition. Instead of wringing out lowest costs the wholesale trading market serves to raise prices they say. As I trade to you and you trade to me we communicate to each other what price we would like to get said Wolak. It's not collusive. It's just communicating price. Mark Palmer a spokesman for Enron the nation's biggest power trader said California's problem is not the result of trading. It's a result of shortages Palmer said. Underscoring its emphasis on trading Enron's new headquarters tower in downtown Houston rises from a six-story block of new trading floors including expanded space for electricity trading. Enron also pioneered trading in cyberspace and its Enron Online site claims to be the most active computer-based trading market. The Houston company argues that consumers won't fully benefit from power trading and deregulation until they have greater choice in choosing their power supplier. And the company says FERC has not done enough to open access to transmission lines which would allow traders to move power around the country. To that end Enron has lobbied hard for President Bush's plan for a national electricity grid. Palmer says the notion that the price of electricity rises each time it is traded is mistaken. The market is always looking for the real price of a commodity Palmer said. Dunn the California state senator says his investigation found a different function for trading. At a time when supply barely meets or falls short of demand he noted companies with electricity to sell have to worry only about how high to set their price. The trader is a pawn in the generator's game to drive up prices said Dunn. Trading develops a level of trust. You my alleged competitor will bid in the same patterns and I will respond not in a competitive pattern but in a complimentary pattern. The state senator said his investigation found evidence that on several days energy companies appeared to test their ability to drive prices up without being undercut by competitors. This ability to drive up prices without competitive consequence is a key test of market power the technical term for manipulation or price fixing. But Dunn also conceded that antitrust violations can be hard to prove in court. He suggested that even if the trading behavior falls short of antitrust violations it remains anti-competitive and devastating for the California economy. To Harry Trebing a utility industry expert and professor emeritus at Michigan State University wholesale electricity trading is reminiscent of what took place in the 1920s and early '30s. Back then utility companies created complex networks of holding companies that traded stock among themselves driving up prices in the process. Undoing that scheme was a focus of President Franklin Roosevelt's administration. Congress ended up barring national power companies and tightening regulation of utilities in an effort to counteract their tendency to create markets that work only for insiders. The broad goals of trading are the same Trebing said. The goal is to maximize profits through raising prices.,"Energy; Trading; California; Regulation

621,HP -- confidential internal document,Matt: As GSS Business Development transitions the HP relationship for broadband to your team there are several issues I wanted to clarify in terms of how the relationship has been developed and who the contacts have been to date. Additionally I outlined the discussion points/action items from this morning's meeting you held with Jennifer Medcalf and myself. Per your request the HP presentation complete with a listing of HP's business partners was e-mailed to you this morning. HP contacts to date: Bill Lovejoy Western Gulf Area Sales Manager Houston TX #(713)-439-5587 (Gerry Cashiola's boss) Gerry Cashiola sales representative Houston TX #(713)-439-5555 (To date HP person coordinating the relationship--seeking a short term play) Greg Pyle Solution Control Manager Southeast Region Austin TX (#(512)-257-5735 (Pyle has been playing the business developer role but continues to defer leadership of the process to Gerry Cashiola) Daniel Morgridge Manager of Internet - E-Services long term alliances Austin TX #(512)-257-5736 (Interested in E-services/wireless longer term alliances) Bill Dwyer Chief Architect e-Services Solutions Cupertino CA #(408)-447-5240 (To date clearly the most knowledgeable person on HP's business propositions strong technical financial background to craft value propositions. Gerry Cashiola and Greg Pyle deferred to his judgement in the 11/16th meeting) Matt On November 10th GSS Business Development took HP through a tour of Enron's trading floor the gas control center and the peaking power plant unit center on the trading floor. This tour was one meeting amongst several held in October and November to provide HP a full overview of Enron's products and services and introduce them to appropriate contacts at Enron (EBS GSS buy side -- Peter Goebel). On November 16th GSS Business Development Patrick Tucker and Dale Clark outlined 3 possible EBS/HP focus areas -- connectivity storage and wireless. Three EBS action items were defined in that meeting: 1) HP was to provide an HP contact on connectivity (to date Gerry Cashiola has stalled on providing this). Sarah-Joy will continue to pursue this information and get a sense from Gerry Cashiola of what he means by short term opportunity. What is HP's time horizon for short term? 2) EBS and GSS/BD was to facilitate a conference call on Storage with Ravi to explore size and potential scope of opportunity (completed 12/8) 3) GSS/BD was to facilitate a conference call with Peter Goebel GSS IT Sourcing Portfolio Leader (set for 12/14) In conversations with you Jennifer Medcalf and myself this morning several decisions on forward-looking strategy with HP/EBS were confirmed: Gerry Cashiola has been unable to take control of the process. More importantly despite numerous visits to Enron in which he has had overviews of Enron's products and services met with Peter Goebel and his team on the GSS buy side and participated in an Experience Enron tour Gerry has been unable to define an HP business proposition. The coordination between Cashiola (short term initiative) Morgridge (long term 12-24 months) has remained unorganized. These initiatives need to be developed separately. Clearly the conversations with HP need to be elevated to a more senior level so EBS can work with HP decision makers who can move the relationship forward at a strategic level. As the relationship is developed at this strategic level shorter term opportunities will crop up along the way. But Gerry's short term plans will not be the focus of the EBS/HP relationship rather a by-product. To facilitate this process of elevating the relationship Jennifer Medcalf and I are following up with Bill Lovejoy and Greg Pyle. Lovejoy's boss is Dan Sytsma VP of HP's America's Central Region. In the conference call Thursday 12/14 with Peter Goebel and HP regarding wireless initiatives Peter will support the GSS/BD push for the HP/EBS initiative by reiterating the following two points: a) Enron is already an HP customer the onus is on HP to move forward on the process of building a strategic relationship (IBM and Lexmark are only some of the HP competitors who could push them out of the running) b) HP's ability to bring the right people to the table will influence HP's business relationship process with Enron Patrick Tucker and Dale Clark could build their relationship with Bill Dwyer Chief Architect e-Services Solutions (met at the meeting 11/16) in the near term. Perhaps plan a visit to Cupertino California to see Dwyer in person. We look forward to continuing close collaboration with your team on this and other opportunities.

Donnelly could lead to a= =20 mass exodus by hundreds of small energy producers that have been selling=20 power to the state's financially troubled utilities for months without=20 getting paid. ?????At the same time it may have staved off plans by a group of the small= =20 generators to send Edison into involuntary bankruptcy as early as today. ?????In Sacramento energy legislation pushed by Gov. Gray Davis passed in= =20 the state Senate but foundered in the Assembly. The measure was intended to= =20 ensure that the state gets repaid for the electricity that it has been buyi= ng=20 on behalf of Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric which say they lack the cas= h=20 and credit to purchase power. The bill also was supposed to guarantee that= =20 the small alternative energy producers--which together provide nearly a=20 third of the state's power--get paid. But Assembly Republicans opposed it= =20 saying it hadn't been given sufficient scrutiny. ?????The impact of the small producers was made clear in Imperial County= =20 where Edison's failure to pay CalEnergy the county's biggest property=20 taxpayer had outsize implications. CalEnergy had put county officials on= =20 notice that it was about to miss a $3.8-million property tax payment. The= =20 uncertainty had prompted the tiny Calipatria Unified School District to=20 postpone a bond issue for badly needed school repairs. ?????Among CalEnergy Chairman David Sokol's first acts after the judge's=20 ruling Thursday was to promise Imperial County Supervisor Wally J. Leimgrub= er=20 that the company would pay its property taxes on time. ?????That is great news Leimgruber said. ?????Within hours of its court victory CalEnergy had stopped transmitting= =20 geothermal power to Edison and begun selling it to El Paso Energy a=20 marketing company that purchased the energy at prevailing rates and resold = it=20 on the spot market. ?????Some of the more than 700 other small energy producers in the state sa= id=20 they were considering similar action against Edison and Pacific Gas &=20 Electric. ?????We absolutely need the right to sell to third parties said Dean=20 Vanech president of Delta Power a New Jersey company that owns five small= =20 gas-fired plants in California and is owed tens of millions of dollars by= =20 Edison. ?????Sokol praised the Imperial County judge and said his company simply=20 wanted the authority to sell its power to a credit-worthy company that in= =20 fact pays for the power. ?????An Edison spokesman said the company was disappointed with the ruling= =20 but sympathized with CalEnergy and other small producers because=20 California's power crisis has placed [them] in financial distress just as= =20 it has placed utilities in financial distress. ?????Edison expressed concern that the ruling would prompt CalEnergy and=20 other small producers to sell their power out of state. Sokol said CalEnerg= y=20 had specifically told El Paso Energy that it hoped its power would remain i= n=20 California but if someone wants to pay a higher price out of state we=20 can't stop them. ?????Sokol said that Edison still owes CalEnergy $140 million and that the= =20 company--along with seven other small producers--had been prepared to file = a=20 petition in federal bankruptcy court in Los Angeles today forcing the utili= ty=20 into involuntary bankruptcy. He said his company no longer intends to do so= =20 and he believed--but wasn't certain--that the other companies would shelve= =20 their plans. ?????Edison filed papers Thursday with the federal Securities and Exchange= =20 Commission showing that it owed $840 million to various small electricity= =20 producers many of which rely on renewable energy sources such as geotherma= l=20 steam solar energy or wind. ?????The alternative energy producers--and utilities--strenuously objected = to=20 the legislation considered in Sacramento on Thursday. The bill spelling ou= t=20 how the utilities are to pay the state and the small producers passed the= =20 Senate on a 27-9 vote the exact two-thirds margin required. But it stalled= =20 in the Assembly on a 46-23 party-line vote well short of two-thirds. ?????When I was a citizen back in Lancaster I heard these stories about= =20 pieces of legislation that were cooked up late at night that . . . were cu= t=20 and pasted together and were rammed through by the Legislature Assemblyma= n=20 George Runner (R-Lancaster) said.

We currently have Ken scheduled to participate in an energy roundtable discussion on the afternoon of the 2nd with at least four governors attending that session--Kempthorne Hull Geringer and Ridge. (Engler and Rowland are also attending the overall event but they will be in a healthcare breakout session). Kaufman and I thought that it would be particularly helpful for Arizona Gov Hull and Idaho Gov Kempthorne to hear Ken's remarks and have a chance to talk with him. I have also been working with Rosalee to schedule an early evening (6:00-7:00pm) meeting that night with Exelon co CEO John Rowe. John Rowe will be in California for some investor meetings and well as attending some sections of the RGA events. I have told my counterpart at Rowe's office that we would confirm Ken's availability on Monday morning. If you do decide that Ken should attend the Davis meeting in Sacremento that day instead we will just reconfigure a bit.

651,Legislative Status Report Week Ending 4/20,Date: 4/20/01 To: Jan Smutny-Jones Steven Kelly Katie Kaplan Cc: IEP Board of Directors From: Julee Malinowski-Ball Edson + Modisette RE: Legislative Status Report Week Ending 4/20 RECENT EVENTS: -- IEP with the help of Chris Ellison has been at the negotiating table mos= t of the week dealing with the most recent amendments to SB 28x. SB 28x (Sher/Battin) makes various changes to the siting process including many IEP-sponsored proposals. As you will recall two new provisions were added to the bill at the last minute before going to the Assembly Floor dealing with both retrofit schedules and environmental dispatch of generating facilities. Per the direction from IEP member companies IEP has decided not to negotiate on the environmental dispatch issue. If the provision remained in the bill IEP would continue to push the Republicans to hold their opposed position. We were however given the authority to negotiate on the retrofit issue as long as we were only talking about facilities that already have retrofit requirements. I will be faxing out the agreed upon language which in essence says the ARB shall set a schedule for the completion of any mandated retrofits. It does not expand the authority of the air districts and ARB to mandate retrofits under existing law. The schedule would require completion of the retrofits by July 1 2004 or such later date as the ISO determines is necessary to maintain reliability. With these amendments including some clean-up language SB 28x will be voted-on on the Assembly floor on Monday and go to the Senate for concurrence on Tuesday. The final version will include the following IEP-sponsored proposals: ? Conforming the timing of offsets for power plants to Clean Air Act requirements ? Substituting CEQA-style hearings for the trial-like proceedings of the CE= C ? Streamlining the permit process for the modernization of existing power plant sites ? Giving consideration to the positive environmental impacts of a proposed project. ? Improving the timeliness and coordination of state and local agency review. ? Extending the current deadlines for the expedited review process established in AB 970. Since SB 28x is only a first step in making changes to the siting process IEP member should now be thinking about what is next. IEP proposals still on the table include: ? Permitting local agencies to make zoning changes or other decisions for power plants contingent upon CEC CEQA Compliance ? Giving deference to other state and regional agencies ? Easing the threshold for override of local land use requirements. ? Making the ISO responsible for determining interconnection requirements -- Bad news on the =01&California First=018 issue quickly followed the good= news. The CEC staff analysis which said the State can't require builders of new power plants to sell electricity here even as a trade-off for expedited permitting was countered by another staff analysis that says the state can= . Both documents cannot be obtained due to attorney-client privilege. This issue is coming to a head next week with a decision pending by the CEC to include a California First clause on the approval of an expedited AES power plant project. AB 60x (Hertzberg) which ties to the siting process the requirement that a developer enter into a contract to sell power to specified California entities is still poised to be heard in the Senate Energy committee. IEP members company lobbyist should continue to lobby against this measure regardless of the CEC=01s decision on AES although our arguments are definitely strengthened if the addition of the clause at the CEC is denied. -- IEP has finalized negotiations with Senator Burton=01s office on amendm= ents attempting to solve our problem with the eminent domain provision in SB 6x (Burton) which is the State Power Authority measure. Attached is a copy o= f the bill in PDF form. The agreed upon language which clarifies that the Authority=01s purpose is to supplement existing generation activities can= be found on pages 6-7 (Section 3310) 13 (Section 3341.1) and 16-17 (Section3352). Considering the inflammatory remarks made by Senator Burton in the press lately regarding seizing generation assets this was most likely the best we could get. -- The first of Senator Dunn=01s hearings with the Senate Select Committee= to Investigate Price Manipulation of the Wholesale Market occurred this week. This week and next week=01s topics will be to go over previous investigati= ons into market power. The committee heard or will be hearing testimony from: Frank Wolak Chairman Market Surveillance Committee CAISO Eric Hildebrandt Manager Market Monitoring CAISO and Elaine Howle State Auditor. -- The Assembly Electricity Oversight Subcommittee met this week and focused on the issue of natural gas collusion. Testifying before the committee were representatives from Dynegy and El Paso commenting on the rise of natural gas prices and whether illegal market manipulation and collusion occurred. The subcommittee plans on putting together a package o= f bills related to natural gas issues which would be the culmination of the committee=01s hearings over the last two months. This package will be up = for consideration first by the whole special Assembly Energy committee. -- Governor Davis came out this week supporting the construction of the Calpine Metcalf Energy Center the 600-megawatt power plant proposed for th= e San Jose region. The Governor urged the CEC to approve the plant siting so that construction can begin. -- Two long-term contracting bills are scheduled for hearings next week. IEP counsel is currently reviewing AB 57 (Wright) and SB 997 (Morrow) and will comment on their provisions as soon as possible. -- Attached is the most recent legislative tracking reports both the special session and regular session.

659,EPSA/EEI on Reliability,This follows up on Rick's inquiry late last week on the talks between EPSA and EEI on reliability. Yesterday I spoke with Mark Bennett and Donn Salvosa of the EPSA staff. Mark did the talking. The upshot is that EPSA and EEI are meeting to see if they can't agree on reliability legislation. EEI is working off of the NERC draft and has sent a version to EPSA dated 9/14 (see attached) that was the basis for last Thursday's meeting. EPSA is now doing some drafting of its own. I need to read the 9/14 draft but the fact that they are working off of the old NERC language is of considerable concern. EPSA staff emphasizes the value of having EEI off the NERC reservation (which is good in terms of showing that there is NERC consensus) but I think EPSA staff may be too flexible in how they are approaching it. I reminded them of our position and concerns and of Jim's prepared statement on EPSA's behalf filed for the Sept. 11 Barton hearing. EPSA staff claims that other EPSA members are OK with them embarking on this project. It is not clear if this effort will succeed. EPSA staff said EEI's board insists on having engineers do reliability which is objectionable to EPSA. EPSA staff seems to think that some type of reliablity SRO is inevitable and that it is wise to get the best one they can. I will check with some other EPSA members.,"Energy; Reliability; EPSA; EEI; NERC

667,Re: CONFIDENTIAL - Residential in CA,Before any decision is made I think we really need to weigh in with EES on the ramifications (both PR and legislative) of turning back 16000 residential customers. I strongly believe that the public hit we will take will be far greater than our actual out-of-pocket losses. We will be crucified by the public media consumer groups legislators governor attorney general etc. and this action will reaffirm our reputation of packing up and leaving when it's not in our interest. The impact of this action would be exacerbated since it is on the heels of UC/CSU. I would also argue that this hurts our national dereg efforts. If we're advocating that competition and choice benefits consumers and then we turn around and pull out of a market and abandon customers when we're not profiting we'll kill any chances we have of ever serving retail customers in California -- or in any other state. We look foolish advocating for direct access when we're not willing to serve our existing -- let alone future customers What about a preemptive strike that engages these 16000 customers to weigh in on direct access -- i.e. a letter that says Enron may be forced to cancel its contract -- call/write/send the enclosed postcard to your legislator and tell them you want to keep your right to choose your energy service provider. Our credibility is on the line. Before we take this action we need to be cognizant of all the long-range strategic implications and we need to seriously weigh the negative impact this will have on our corporate reputation on our legislative abilities and on our commercial success going forward. kd James D Steffes 04/12/2001 09:05 PM To: Jeff Dasovich/NA/Enron@Enron Paul Kaufman/PDX/ECT@ECT Sandra McCubbin/NA/Enron@Enron Richard Shapiro/NA/Enron@Enron Janel Guerrero/Corp/Enron@Enron Mark Palmer/Corp/Enron@ENRON Karen Denne/Corp/Enron@ENRON Susan J Mara/NA/Enron Peggy Mahoney/HOU/EES@EES Harry Kingerski/NA/Enron@Enron cc: Dan Leff/HOU/EES@EES Subject: CONFIDENTIAL - Residential in CA In the meeting today no decision was made about what to do with Enron's 16000 residential customers.

The problem was this: Daly insisted someone speak on behalf of the group to the press (and designated Terry to be the one) Terry did not have the updated information that we were about to meet with the government officials and deliver a slightly different message (i.e. that we needed to know if the government planned to really open Petrobras or not -- the implication being that we would work within either decision but we needed to know one way or the other) Terry was simply not in possession of this information and no one had given it to him (probably because they had no reason to assume that Terry would be thrust in front of the press) moreover it's hard to see how Terry could have taken such a position publicly anyway. By my eyes Terry did the best he could and we had an unavoidable communications bust.

From March 2000 to February 2001 natural gas prices have risen 489 percent compared to a 266 percent increase in New Mexico and a 247 percent jump in Chicago. ??Steinberg asked Ralph Eads the president of an El Paso Natural Gas Co. subsidiary for an explanation. ??The 275 percent difference you say is attributable completely to constraints on the pipeline and demand? Steinberg asked. ??Yes Eads replied. Eads said the state's energy crisis which led power plants to run harder and longer dramatically increased demand for natural gas over the summer and a winter with temperatures about 15 percent cooler than the year before exacerbated the problem. ??In another twist to California's deregulation nightmare El Paso officials said they gained greater control of the pipeline after the Pacific Gas & Electric Co. relinquished the capacity four years ago. At that time PG&E's movement of the gas and the prices it could charge were regulated by the Public Utilities Commission. ??In other developments at the Capitol on Thursday lawmakers called on the federal government to re- regulate natural gas sales at the California border and U.S. Sen. Joe Lieberman D-Conn. said federal regulators should impose price caps on California's wholesale electricity market. ??The Assembly held considerable debate on the resolution asking for re-regulation with Democrats accusing President George W. Bush of doing nothing to come to the aid of California and Republicans defending the administration. ??I'm learning an interesting lesson that all the problems of the world started after Jan. 21 and the inauguration of the new president said Assemblyman Bill Leonard R-San Bernardino. ??KRT CALIFORNIA is a premium service of Knight Ridder/Tribune ??(c) 2001 Contra Costa Times (Walnut Creek Calif.). ??Visit the Contra Costa Times on the Web at http://www.cctimes.com/ JOURNAL-CODE: CC LOAD-DATE: April 20 2001 of 78 DOCUMENTS 2001 / Los Angeles Times Angeles Times ?????????????????????April 20 2001 Friday Home Edition SECTION: Part A Part 1 Page 3 Metro Desk LENGTH: 715 words HEADLINE: CALIFORNIA AND THE WEST A U-TURN ON CAR TAX REBATES LEGISLATION: STARTING JULY 1 FEE REDUCTION WILL BE FIGURED DIRECTLY INTO VEHICLE REGISTRATION BILLS NOT REFUNDED BY MAIL. BYLINE: CARL INGRAM TIMES STAFF WRITER DATELINE: SACRAMENTO BODY: ??Gov. Gray Davis and the Legislature spun a U-turn Thursday and scrapped a costly program that requires motorists to first pay their car tax and then get a rebate in the mail. ??Starting July 1 the state Department of Motor Vehicles will send owners of approximately 26 million vehicles registration renewal bills already reduced by the amount of the vehicle license fee rebates. ??On a unanimous roll call the Senate voted final approval and sent to Davis an urgency bill SB 52 that repealed the rebate program which the governor had previously fought for and defended. ??In addition to abolishing the rebates the legislation reduces by 67.5% the amount motorists must pay for the upcoming year the level that lawmakers and former Gov. Pete Wilson envisioned in 1998 when they began cutting the fee. It had been about 2% of a vehicle's market value. ??Davis immediately signed the repeal bill saying only that the new law will expedite relief to taxpayers and greatly reduce administrative costs. ??The governor's muted observation contrasted with his effusive support of the rebates last year when he said Californians don't appreciate the fact that they're getting a rebate unless they see it in their hands. ??At the time Davis and the Legislature had the choice of simply cutting the car tax which voters might not notice or sending checks in the mail which Davis felt would have a greater impact. ??The rebates which began Jan. 1 were scheduled to continue through 2002 when Davis intends to run for reelection. In 2003 the license fee was to have fallen permanently with no more rebates. ??The whole rebate scheme was good only through the next gubernatorial election cycle said Sen. Tom McClintock (R-Thousand Oaks) who supported reductions in the license fee but opposed the rebates. ??Until July 1 the DMV will continue to bill motorists for the full amount of their license fee which includes a 35% reduction from last year. ??Then we return to you an additional 32.5% rebate making a total reduction of 67.5% said DMV spokesman Bill Branch. Starting with license renewals on July 1 the DMV bills will include the full tax cut. ??A Senate analysis of the repeal bill noted that the current awkward system . . . effectively requires taxpayers to overpay their vehicle license fee and then await a rebate check from the state--a system that is at best difficult to explain. ??But as the California economy tightened the state's budget surplus shrank and taxpayers shelled out approximately $ 50 million a day to buy electricity the costs of the rebate program threatened to become a political embarrassment to Davis. ??Projected administrative and postage costs of the rebate program alone were estimated at $ 22 million this year and another $ 22 million or so next year. ??Last year state Sen. Joe Dunn (D-Santa Ana) and McClintock sought to eliminate the rebates and give drivers their full tax cuts when they register their vehicles. Under pressure from Davis the bill failed. ??It was killed behind the scenes at the insistence of the governor McClintock said Thursday. He didn't want it on his desk. ??This year Dunn launched a similar bill but his name was struck from it as the lead author in the Assembly and the name of Sen. Wes Chesbro (D-Arcata) was substituted. ??In a speech Thursday Sen. Ross Johnson (R-Irvine) suggested that Davis' performance on the issue in an earlier time and a more just society would have resulted in his public flogging by representatives of taxpayers. ??The repeal bill was passed 78 to 0 by the Assembly on Monday and sent to Davis by the Senate on a 34-0 vote Thursday. ??If the rebates were to be abolished the bill had to pass this week in order to take effect July 1 said Branch the DMV spokesman. This is because motorists must be advised 60 days in advance that their registration renewals are due. ??We have to reprogram all the computers. We have to print new bills and mail them by May 1 for the July 1 expiration he said. It will be a little tight but we will still make it. ??Branch said that since the Jan. 1 start of rebates checks totaling $ 454 million have been sent to 7.4 million vehicle owners at an extra administrative cost of $ 9.4 million.

Bill Lockyer ratcheting up his investigation of possible civil and criminal violations by the state's power suppliers is asking a San Francisco judge to order two firms to hand over confidential records. ??In a motion filed Thursday in Superior Court Lockyer said Reliant Energy and Mirant Corp. have failed to comply with subpoenas for documents that were to be produced by March 19. ??Amid soaring electricity costs and rolling blackouts the attorney general launched an investigation of possible manipulation of wholesale electricity prices that have skyrocketed to record levels and have financially crippled the state's major utilities. ??Dozens of other public and private power suppliers are complying with the subpoenas. ??But in an interview Lockyer accused Reliant and Mirant of stonewalling investigators so they can keep enjoying these exorbitant profits and prices for as long as possible. ??Ultimately the companies will have to honor the subpoenas he said. I'm going to pit bull them he said. This is one we win. ??Both companies say they have done nothing wrong and played by the rules of California's flawed electricity deregulation plan. ??A spokesman for Houston-based Reliant said Thursday the firm is seeking court action of its own to ensure that sensitive business information will not be shared with other public agencies or its competitors. ??Last week Reliant asked a Los Angeles Superior Court judge to clarify the attorney general's obligation to keep proprietary information confidential. ??We're glad to cooperate with his investigation to the extent we can said Reliant spokesman Richard Wheatley.  But we have not received sufficient assurances that Lockyer would keep the data confidential. ??Lockyer called Reliant's court filing frivolous and propagandistic and insisted that adequate safeguards are in place. He reserves the right under state law to share information with other government agencies aiding in his investigation but has said he will keep sensitive business information from being made public. ??Atlanta-based Mirant demanded and received similar guarantees of confidentiality Lockyer said. Mirant did not return phones calls Thursday. ??Lockyer did not discuss details of the probe or the kinds of information he's seeking. But based on the investigation so far he said it's beginning to get interesting. ??Other records indicate that the attorney general has sought 91 categories of information about the power merchants' activities. They include the operation of power plants trading information that may have been shared by private power suppliers and bidding strategies in the California market.

S. MUST STEP IN TO PROTECT STATE FROM MANIPULATION BY SUPPLIERS. BYLINE: MITCHELL LANDSBERG and MIGUEL BUSTILLO TIMES STAFF WRITERS BODY: ??This may be the surest sign yet of the depth of California's energy crisis: A bipartisan cross-section of the state's congressional delegation brought together Thursday by Gov. Gray Davis not only agreed about the severity of the problem but also about the need for swift federal intervention. ??This meeting did not have the word 'Democrat' or 'Republican' used once Rep. Darrell E. Issa (R-Vista) said of the unusual spirit of cooperation at the meeting near Los Angeles International airport. ??Members of both parties said the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission must slash wholesale electricity prices so California utilities can once again afford to buy power. Since January the state government has been buying electricity on their behalf as skyrocketing wholesale prices put Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Southern California Edison billions of dollars into debt and many power suppliers refused to sell to them PG&E has since filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. ??Although the Bush administration has said repeatedly that it is strongly opposed to price caps and FERC has refused to grant them California Republicans at the energy meeting said they are optimistic that the administration will agree to some other form of price regulation. They brushed aside the notion that such regulations might conflict with their ideological belief in a free market. ??This is not a free-enterprise situation Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Alpine) said after the meeting. In fact it's just the opposite. ??Specifically citing the huge disparity between natural gas prices charged to California and those charged in other Western states he said California clearly has been the victim of unreasonably high energy costs. Under federal law the FERC must regulate the prices of companies if it finds they are exerting market power to drive prices to unreasonable levels. ??Executives from two Texas energy companies meeting with legislators in Sacramento denied Thursday that they had caused natural gas prices in California to artificially skyrocket by hoarding access to a critical pipeline into the state. ??After the extraordinary meeting in Los Los Angeles Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) said the biggest disagreement between California Democrats and Republicans appeared to be their relative faith--or lack thereof--in the ability of President Bush and his administration to help California. There has been much speculation that Bush who lost California in November has no political motive to help the state. ??We Democrats said Sherman hope very much that our skepticism is proven wrong. ??Davis--who sat flanked by Democratic U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein and the governor's newly appointed chief energy advisor S. David Freeman--said he used the meeting mainly to discuss the importance of conservation by Californians this summer and to ask the congressional delegation to pitch in. Five Republicans and more than a dozen Democrats attended the gathering. ??Feinstein said Thursday that she has asked for a third time to meet with Bush to discuss the energy situation. Meeting with Times reporters and editors Wednesday she described a recent meeting with Vice President Dick Cheney in which she said he ignored her appeal for federal assistance. ??Feinstein has been among those critical of natural gas companies saying they appear to have constricted access to a California-bound pipeline to run up prices. ??The Brattle Group a respected consulting firm alleged Wednesday before an Assembly committee that Dynegy Inc. and El Paso Natural Gas Co. had manipulated the market by charging so much for the rights to their pipeline capacity that they had in effect withheld access to it. ??That action the experts said directly forced companies trying to deliver gas to California to look for alternatives clogging other pipelines and causing a surge in prices. ??The explanation El Paso executives said was simple: Demand for gas soared in California because generators that use gas to make electricity increased production last year in response to the energy crisis. ??We're not withholding capacity--no one is said El Paso Merchant Energy President Ralph Eads. With these prices you want to sell every molecule. ??In other developments Thursday: ??* The agreement between Davis and Edison International to return its ailing utility arm to financial health is in deep trouble and could be rejected by legislators the Standard & Poor's credit rating agency said in a note to clients citing legislative and other sources. A rejection of the deal would be a humiliating setback for the governor S&P said. ??The agreement calls for among other things the sale of Edison's transmission grid to the state for $ 2.76 billion and the sale of $ 2 billion in bonds--both designed to pay off the utility's huge electricity debt. Edison agreed to several constraints including the sale of electricity to the state at prices tied to the cost of producing power. ??Since they returned Monday from a two-week recess state legislators have been sharply critical of the Edison agreement and have indicated a desire to tinker with aspects of the deal. Some lawmakers have said publicly that a bankruptcy protection filing by Edison like that of PG&E might not be such a dire outcome. ??But a senior Edison executive said it is way too early to give up on passage of the proposal which legislators have not yet seen in official form. ??There is an education process to do here the executive said of the highly detailed 38-page document. The legislators should be asking questions. That is appropriate. ??* The Public Utilities Commission voted to investigate whether alternative energy providers violated contractual agreements by withholding supplies from PG&E and Edison which owe them hundreds of millions of dollars. ??The action Commissioner Carl W. Wood said was prompted in part by lawsuits some providers have filed seeking release from their contracts with the cash-starved utilities. The producers of solar wind and geothermal energy account for more than 25% of California's electricity supply. ??The question is whether we will be able to rely on them in the long hot days of summer Wood said. ??Jack Raudy of the Renewable Energy Creditors Committee said the PUC needs to address the $ 700 million the producers are owed. All we have gotten is rhetoric from the governor the PUC and the utilities he said. ??* An $ 850-million plan to entice Californians to conserve precious megawatts appears to be running into roadblocks compounding predictions by state officials of tighter than expected energy supplies in May and June. ??Davis signed the conservation spending package last week earmarking $ 242 million of the new funds for the Public Utilities Commission to distribute to the state's investor-owned utilities to support existing conservation programs. ??But Barbara Hale director of the PUC's Division of Strategic Planning said Thursday that since Pacific Gas & Electric Co. filed for bankruptcy protection April 6 the utility has stopped releasing conservation funds. ??Hale testifying before a state Senate committee said PG&E's decision--coupled with the threat that Southern California Edison could follow a similar route to U.S. Bankruptcy Court--has complicated her agency's efforts. ??PG&E spokeswoman Staci Homrig said her company plans to petition the Bankruptcy Court to have the conservation funds designated as a trust and separated from assets tied up in the bankruptcy proceedings. She said if the court denies the request PG&E would ask to be permitted to pay the expenses anyway. The process she added could take about a month--too long in the view of some legislators given increasingly gloomy energy forecasts for late spring and early summer. ??Deputy Director Bob Therkelsen of the California Energy Commission said his agency had been counting on a number of small power producers to bolster their output during that period. But he said some producers did not purchase the necessary equipment because PG&E and Edison have failed to pay them in full for earlier electricity deliveries. ??It's not a huge amount he said of the anticipated production shortfall but every little bit helps. ??* ??Landsberg reported from Los Angeles Bustillo from Sacramento.

There is some willingness they say to consider some price controls even though the Bush administration is adamantly opposed to such measures. ??Many are looking to see if President Bush's choices for the two vacancies on FERC will provide a margin for change. ??But the commission's basic philosophy that open unregulated markets are best is not likely to change soon members say. ??I've been championing a revamping of FERC's antiquated standards for determining market-based rates Commissioner Richard Massey said Thursday. But with no success.  My agency is not on the verge of turning on a dime on this market-based pricing. ??The standards are a joke Massey added because the commission never turns down requests for such pricing authority. More than 600 power sellers have been given that authority he said. ??For a power company to be allowed to charge whatever the market will bear it must show FERC for example that it doesn't have the power to manipulate the market and drive prices up. ??Any seller that can't pass our screen needs to fire their consultants and lawyers Massey said. ??While the overall philosophy remains consistent FERC staff has proposed to the commission that a Stage 3 electricity emergency in California should trigger cost-based rates a form of price controls. Such triggers would be in place for one year under the staff proposal. ??The commission may decide Wednesday whether to accept that proposal. It has to make some decision by May 1 on how the market will be monitored from now on. ??The theory behind controlling prices in Stage 3 says a FERC staff report is that during such an emergency generators have the greatest opportunity to manipulate the market and drive prices up. ??But generators have that power during Stage 2 and Stage 1 emergencies says Les Starck Southern California Edison Co.'s manager of federal regulatory affairs. Price caps during Stage 3 might avert the rolling blackouts associated with that level of crisis but they wouldn't do anything to stop generators from jacking up prices the rest of the time he said. ??It is not clear how long it would take for such price controls to take effect should the commission go along with the staff recommendation. ??We're close because summer is approaching Commissioner Linda Breathitt said Thursday. Breathitt who had firmly opposed any form of price controls said in an interview last month that given the worsening crisis in California she was open to considering some short-term measures. ??It's important to me that we address the summer Breathitt said but said she wasn't able to predict what the commission would do Wednesday. ??Even if an order is approved Massey said there could be delays while the power sellers file their costs with regulators and disputes over those filings are handled. ??Sen. Dianne Feinstein said Thursday such a move by the commission would be better than having no controls at all. There's no question that we're going to be in a Stage 3 emergency. ??Feinstein D-Calif. and other Western lawmakers have been urging FERC to step in sooner and with price controls that extend beyond just the emergency period. ??Waiting for Stage 3 to intervene is putting the whole grid at risk said Roger Hamilton a member of Oregon's Public Utility Commission. We have a real stability problem when you cut it that close. ??Feinstein says the future could well rest with the new commissioners particularly Patrick Wood the head of the Texas PUC who many believe will replace Curt Heber as FERC chairman if he is confirmed by the Senate. ??Even if Massey and Breathitt agree on broader price controls as chairman Heber could block consideration of such a move. It's unclear what stance Wood would take as chairman. ??The thing that deeply concerns me about Pat Wood is that he's from Texas Feinstein said. What's reassuring is that it appears from my personal discussion with him is that he appears to be pragmatic. ??But once again timing could be a problem. ??Bush has said he intends to nominate Wood and Nora Brownell a member of the Pennsylvania PUC but has not formally sent their nominations to the Senate. ??The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is of vital importance right now and to let the time go on without filling the spots makes no sense Feinstein said. Please please please President Bush process your nominees. ??KRT CALIFORNIA is a premium service of Knight Ridder/Tribune ??(c) 2001 The Orange County Register (Santa Ana Calif.). ??Visit the Register on the World Wide Web at http://www.ocregister.com/ JOURNAL-CODE: OC LOAD-DATE: April 20 2001 of 78 DOCUMENTS ??????????????Copyright 2001 Knight Ridder/Tribune News Service ???????????????????????Knight Ridder/Tribune News Service Jose Mercury News 20 2001 Friday SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS KR-ACC-NO: ?K512 LENGTH: 696 words HEADLINE: In response to power woes rating agencies have California on credit watch BYLINE: By Jennifer Bjorhus BODY: ??SAN JOSE Calif. _ All three of the nation's influential judges of credit risk now have California on credit watch saying they are deeply concerned about the economic impact of the state's power crisis. ??The Fitch credit rating agency made it unanimous Wednesday when it warned that the thickening electricity quagmire as well as lower than expected tax revenues in February and March could spell broader risk for the state's budget. ??The announcement is a signal that Fitch too may downgrade its ratings on California's nearly $30 billion in public debt a move which could cost taxpayers millions. ??The announcement comes as state lawmakers mull a bailout plan for Southern California Edison Pacific Gas & Electric Co. sits in bankruptcy and state officials bleed through the state's general fund as they purchase expensive electricity for consumers. Earlier this week Gov. Gray Davis announced that the average daily bill for electricity purchases has risen from $45.8 million a day in the last week of March to $73 million a day. ??Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's have already issued their own credit warnings although none of the three agencies has actually downgraded the state's very good double-A credit rating. ??Bond ratings are important yardsticks that bankers and investors use to price municipal and corporate bonds. A downgrade would force California to offer bondbuyers higher interest rates going forward costing taxpayers. ??The state was last at a lower A rating back in 1994. ??Moody's changed California's Aa2 general obligation bond rating outlook from stable to negative on April 6 the day Pacific Gas & Electric Co. filed for bankruptcy. Standard & Poor's has had the state's AA rating outlook at negative since January when the state began buying electricity for the utilities. ??The deciding factor for Fitch said Fitch vice chairman Claire Cohen was the disagreement over how the money from the new electricity rate hike will be spent. ??The California Public Utilities Commission ruled in late March that money generated by higher electricity bills should go first to pay the state Department of Water Resources which has been buying electricity for the utilities. Pacific Gas & Electric Co. has argued that if the state is paid first there won't be any money left for it. ??The utility is formally challenging the PUC decision and the move threatens to hold up the estimated $12 billion to $14 billion of bonds the Department of Water Resources plans to issue to buy more electricity. ??With that being appealed you don't have a clean authorization Cohen said. It signals to me that it could delay the financing process. ??A second concern is that the state isn't collecting as much in taxes as expected Cohen said. Tax collections for both February and March were below forecast. The amount of personal income tax the state collected in those months fell short by $455 million or 14% less than expected. ??Cohen said she made her decision before hearing that the state's power costs now exceed $70 million a day. Cohen and David Hitchcock the California analyst for Standard & Poors agreed those rising costs are a definite concern. ??It doesn't take much of a change in economic growth to make some of these projected fund balances disappear and so we're very worried about what the current economic activity is particularly in Northern California with some of the problems with the high tech area Hitchcock told analysts and investors last week in a conference call. ??State treasurer Phillip Angelides was traveling Thursday and couldn't be reached for comment. Other economy-watchers expressed concern. ??Sandy Harrison assistant director of the state Dept. of Finance said the move reinforced the importance of solving the current power problems soon. ??It's important to note that the rating hasn't been lowered yet and does remain very strong he said. ??KRT CALIFORNIA is a premium service of Knight Ridder/Tribune ??(c) 2001 San Jose Mercury News (San Jose Calif.). ??Visit Mercury Center the World Wide Web site of the Mercury News at http://www.sjmercury.com/ JOURNAL-CODE: SJ LOAD-DATE: April 20 2001 of 78 DOCUMENTS ??????????????Copyright 2001 Knight Ridder/Tribune News Service ???????????????????????Knight Ridder/Tribune News Service Jose Mercury News 20 2001 Friday SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS KR-ACC-NO: ?K520 LENGTH: 1069 words HEADLINE: Issues still remain on what power consumers will eventually pay BYLINE: By John Woolfolk and Michael Bazeley BODY: ??SAN JOSE Calif. _ State regulators last month announced an electric rate increase that would average a whopping three cents per kilowatt hour hit bills beginning in May and punish power pigs while sparing energy misers. ??Now much of that is up in the air. ??Higher rates are surely coming _ but not before June. Exactly which consumers and businesses will pay how much is uncertain as regulators rush to forge a rate structure from a tangle of more than 20 proposals. ??Their task has been complicated immeasurably by Gov. Gray Davis' decision to weigh in with a competing rate plan and Pacific Gas & Electric's move into bankruptcy court. ??Little details are moving billions of dollars around said Nettie Hoge of consumer advocate group TURN. ??All the proposals assume a tiered structure that forces the heaviest users of energy to pay the most. But key details yet to be decided mean consumers could see their average rates go up anywhere from 7 percent to 30 percent or more. ??Among them: ??_How much of an overall increase? The Public Utilities Commission approved a 3-cent per kilowatt hour increase last month which would boost utility revenue $4.8 million. Gov. Gray Davis' hike _ left vague in Davis' April 5 television address _ averages 2.8 cents for PG&E customers but only 2.3 cents for customers of Southern California Edison. ??_What regions of the state will pay? The commission agreed to raise rates only for Pacific Gas & Electric and Southern California Edison but Davis would include the additional 1.2 million San Diego Gas & Electric customers. ??_Should heavier users of electricity subsidize those who are exempt from the new rate increase? If so those users will find themselves paying much more than any of the average increase figures being tossed about. ??_How will utilities bill customers retroactively for the increase? At the time of the PUC vote on March 27 commissioner said their increase would take effect immediately. ??Various plans are being presented this week to an administrative law judge working for the commission. The judge is expected to recommend a rate structure to the PUC on May 4. Public hearings would follow May 7-11 and the commission would vote on a plan May 14 condensing to a few weeks a process that normally lasts nearly a year. ??Each of the major proposals before the commission assumes that residential customers using less than 130 percent of their baseline would be exempt from higher rates. That's mandated under a new law that allows the state to buy power. Customers already pay higher rates for exceeding their baseline which is the average basic level of use for each region of the state. ??Each major proposal also sets new tiers with progressively higher rates for medium use at 130 to 200 percent of baseline and heavy use over 200 percent of that level. ??But that's where the similarities end. ??The first distinction among the leading plans comes in the form of an assumption: How many residential customers will avoid any increase because they don't exceed 130 percent of their baseline? Davis says more than half commissioners say a little under half and PG&E says less than a third. ??The second difference among the plans is a real difference: What happens to everyone else? ??Under the plan by utilities commission President Loretta Lynch medium PG&E users would see average bills rise 9 percent and heavy users would see bills increase 36 percent. ??Davis' plan says medium PG&E users would see average bills rise 11 percent while heavy users would pay 37 percent more. But the average total bill increase for PG&E residential customers including those who are exempt would be 20 percent under his plan and 24 percent under Lynch's according to a statement on the governor's web site. ??Business customers would see proportionately greater increases averaging 30 percent under Lynch's proposal and 26 percent under Davis'. ??The most consumer-friendly of the various proposals comes from consumer-rights group TURN. They suggest an overall average residential increase of just 7.5 percent. ??TURN's plan assumes utilities cannot charge other customers more to make up for the energy misers shielded from rate increases under state law. ??PG&E disagrees with that interpretation. The utility wants other residential users to make up for any lost revenue from exempted customers through higher rates. Under the utility's plan residential customers would see an average rate hike of nearly 30 percent. ??The proposal these folks are pushing rips the heart out of that law said Matthew Freedman staff attorney for TURN. ??Another issue affecting consumers is how the utilities can bill for electricity used in April and May before the final plan is approved. ??Utility officials have objected to making the rate structure retroactive. Instead to recoup the revenue they are proposing a flat surcharge that everyone would pay regardless of how much they use. ??Edison proposes a higher surcharge added to bills for a shorter period of time _ in this case June through August. PG&E officials are suggesting a smaller surcharge that would be spread out over 12 months. ??It'll probably be something closer to the PG&E proposal Paul Clanon the commission's director of energy issues. ??All the rate increase proposals stem from a commonly understood problem: California's current frozen rates don't generate enough money to cover the wholesale price of power. The PUC raised rates 10 percent _ or 1 cent per kilowatt hour _ in January in an attempt to help but that turned out to be far from enough. ??In March the Commission approved an additional 3-cent increase. But Davis followed quickly with an alternative proposal. The next day PG&E filed for bankruptcy raising the specter that a federal judge could order even higher rates. ??Although the PUC has sole authority to raise rates under state law Davis' proposal has complicated an already complex process. The governor appointed three of the five members of the commission and his appointees seem inclined to show him deference. But Davis has been slow in filing the details of his plan which has made it hard for the PUC to proceed. ??KRT CALIFORNIA is a premium service of Knight Ridder/Tribune ??(c) 2001 San Jose Mercury News (San Jose Calif.). ??Visit Mercury Center the World Wide Web site of the Mercury News at http://www.sjmercury.com/ JOURNAL-CODE: SJ LOAD-DATE: April 20 2001 of 78 DOCUMENTS ?????????????????Copyright 2001 The Chronicle Publishing Co. ?????????????????????????The San Francisco Chronicle ????????????????????APRIL 20 2001 FRIDAY FINAL EDITION SECTION: NEWS Pg. A4 LENGTH: 765 words HEADLINE: Edison pushes lawmakers to accept deal SOURCE: Chronicle Staff Writer BYLINE: David Lazarus BODY: Although lawmakers are skeptical of the state's multibillion-dollar deal to acquire the power lines of Southern California Edison the head of the utility's parent company warned yesterday that failure to approve the accord could lead to a long and costly bankruptcy. ???But John Bryson chief executive of Edison International told The Chronicle that he thought legislators would want to do the right thing by approving the multibillion-dollar agreement and preventing Edison from following Pacific Gas and Electric Co. into bankruptcy court. ???Bankruptcy for California's two largest utilities could have severe consequences for consumers. Financial analysts said a worsening of the state's energy mess would increase the possibility of higher electricity rates. ???Nevertheless lawmakers are unlikely to accept the Edison deal -- at least not in its present form. ???We are going to go through this thing extensively said state Senate President Pro Tem John Burton D-San Francisco. There are a lot of concerns about the valuation. ???Still he said legislative backing for the accord remains possible as long as Edison is open to amending some of the terms. ???The Edison people are smart enough to know that the Legislature is going to have its say Burton said. ???Indeed sources familiar with the matter said Edison expected a certain amount of tinkering with the deal and would not resist efforts to reach common ground with lawmakers. ???The Assembly members do not view bankruptcy as a favorable alternative said Assemblyman Herb Wesson D-Los Angeles. There will be a big effort to try and work something out. ???Edison's Bryson seems eager at this point to present himself and his company as reasonable business partners who are willing to negotiate in good faith. ???This contrasts sharply with the state's relations with PG&E which turned acrimonious after PG&E blindsided the governor with its bankruptcy filing. Each side blamed the other for the collapse of earlier negotiations. ???We made the decision at an early stage that this was a massive problem for the state and that the best course was to find a practical solution that would allow us to get on with operating our power system Bryson said. ???Bankruptcy he said is absolutely a last resort. It's a long and costly process. ???It is also the last thing Wall Street wants to see. On Wednesday rating agency Fitch Inc. joined Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investor Service in warning that California's credit rating could be lowered because of the state's energy mess. ???The state may be forced to issue junk bonds said Carol Coale an energy-industry analyst at Prudential Securities in New York. This could lead to a surcharge on electricity bills to guarantee the bonds. ???Bryson not surprisingly defended Edison's agreement with the governor as a prudent alternative to bankruptcy. ???This is a very good deal for the state he said. It is not a bailout. Edison gives up a lot to make all this possible. ???Southern California Edison will sell its power lines to the state for $2.8 billion. It also will provide low-cost power to California for 10 years and drop a federal lawsuit seeking full recovery of nearly $5 billion in past debt. ???Critics say the state is paying far too much for Edison's transmission system -- more than two times book value -- and that the power lines are of little use unless PG&E's grid also can be acquired. ???It's a multibillion-dollar ratepayer bailout of Edison said Doug Heller a spokesman for the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in Santa Monica. Edison gets off scot-free. ???Under the most likely scenario lawmakers will seek to reduce the amount paid for Edison's power lines and to increase the role of the California Public Utilities Commission in regulating the utility. ???They also will try to come up with a workable contingency plan for the state if PG&E remains adamant in its refusal to sell off its part of the power grid. ???The deal on the table is still salvageable said Michael Shames executive director of the Utility Consumers' Action Network in San Diego. But Edison needs to understand that what it got from the governor is only a framework not set in stone. ???For his part Bryson signaled that plenty of room existed for give and take on the issue. ???We're just at the initial stage he said. We always have accepted the notion that Edison is a California regulated utility and is subject to the laws of the Public Utilities Commission.E-mail David Lazarus at dlazarus@sfchronicle.com.

The previous administration felt compelled to dominate the evening news every day and the president said 'I'm focused on getting the job done' Rove said Wednesday in an Associated Press interview. ??Running a low-key presidency sets Bush apart from former President Clinton but the style has its critics. ??Some lawmakers including members of his own party said Bush could have saved more of his $1.6 trillion tax-cut plan if he had personally lobbied more lawmakers. ??Bush issued a statement expressing sympathy with police and protesters in Cincinnati but ran the risk of looking detached. ??And Rove acknowledged that there was some discussion in the White House about Bush attending the U.S. crew's homecoming to reap the public relations reward for freeing the crew. ??But the president vetoed the idea according to Rove who quoted Bush as saying I want it to be about them and I don't want to go through the discombobulation that it would require of them and their families for me to show up. ??It is not hard to imagine Clinton commanding center stage during city riots a budget battle or an international crisis but Rove said We intended to have a smaller profile than the previous administration. ??Bush's attitude is that he's not going to be measured by whether or not he gets on the evening news but on whether or not he gets progress Rove said during the 45-minute interview. ??He sat at a polished wood conference table in his West Wing office his hands folded over a memo he had discretely turned upside down. Newspapers and a Starbucks coffee mug littered his desktop. Framed photos and artwork were propped against a chair still awaiting hanging on his 89th day in the White House. ??A painting of a Texas landscape decorated one wall allowing Bush's political strategist of eight years to go on vacation whenever I'm on the phone. ??Rove is on the telephone a lot these days crafting strategies to pass the White House legislative agenda maintain GOP control of Congress in 2002 and position the president for a re-election bid in 2004. ??Bush narrowly won the White House without California's 54 electoral votes and Rove said the president could win re-election without the state but it's always nicer to carry the Golden State. ??He said the state's electricity shortage will not hurt Bush's chances in 2004 adding that the administration has done virtually everything Gov. Gray Davis has requested. ??He suggested that the state caused its own problems by not building enough power plants and failing to follow the lead of other states such as Bush's Texas to establish sound energy policies before a crisis struck. ??This has got a very human dimension to it Rove said. It's one thing to talk about power supplies. It's another thing when you talk about how it affects their jobs how it's affecting their livelihoods how it's affecting the safety of their communities and the health of their families. This is a tough issue and it ought to be a wake up call for the entire country. ??A White House task force headed by Vice President Dick Cheney is working on recommendations to address both short-term problems of soaring electricity and natural gas prices and longer-term energy supply problems focusing on producing more domestic oil and gas and building more electric power plants. ??Rove said the administration will soon unveil new conservation measures aimed at helping California ease its shortages. ??He said Bush and his political team are bringing House Republicans from politically competitive states to the White House where they discuss their districts' needs and often gain local media attention. ??Bush also plans to attend fund-raisers for House and Senate campaign committees helping the party gear up for 2002 midterm elections in which control of Congress is at stake. ??Rove also said: ??-Bush will not seek broad authority to negotiate trade treaties anytime soon allowing time to make the legislation more attractive to Democrats. You can only put so much into that pipe and we've stuffed it he said of Bush's crowded legislative agenda. The fast track authority is key to Bush's plans for a free trade zone stretching from Canada to Chile. That proposal is the focus of the three-day Summit of the Americas beginning Friday in Quebec City. ??-Americans will support Bush's environmental policies despite criticism of his decision to overturn some initiatives of the final days of the Clinton administration. Rove stopped short of accusing Clinton of setting Bush up for political troubles. I'm not certain I see a conspiracy there. I do think it's interesting that Clinton waited until the last moment to act. ??-Bush has not wavered since the campaign in his view that states should be able to opt out of minimum wage increases passed by Congress. We are not all one single labor market Rove said.

The regulatory staff recommends a $108.7 million increase. For residential customers a requested 34-percent hike would be reduced to 16 percent. ??This is not a final decision said Jeff Beaman a spokesman for IDACORP and Idaho Power. In many cases the commissioners disagree with the staff. ??The report noted there was nothing illegal about the transactions between Idaho Power and its sister company Idaho Energy Systems. To change that the staff urged commissioners to create a mechanism that forces Idaho Power to buy electricity at the same price Idaho Energy Systems pays for it. ??The report said Idaho Energy Systems an unregulated subsidiary of IDACORP repeatedly purchased electricity on the wholesale market and then sold it to Idaho Power for a profit. ??Idaho Power officials contend the recommended policy change could financially cripple the company. It already spent $161 million buying power on the open market and cannot recover the money unless the coming year's rate is increased. ??The failure to recoup these funds could lead to liquidity problems Beaman said and that will hurt not only the company but our customers as well. ??But IDACORP paid all of its salaried staff - including Idaho Power employees - a 15-percent bonus at the end of the last fiscal year because the company had achieved record profits of $139.9 million 53 percent over the year before. ??Beaman said incentive payments have no impact on the rate request. ??Charging the higher rate between the two subsidiaries was the result of a commission order tying the price that Idaho Energy charges for wholesale electricity to the Mid-Columbia Index. The index has been pegged at unrealistic levels since the energy crisis erupted in California and fluctuates constantly. ??We are confident that the transactions were performed within the letter and spirit of the law and have not been at the expense of ratepayers Beaman said. ??Commission spokesman Gene Fadness said commissioners cannot comment on a case before them but their ultimate decision can be appealed to the Idaho Supreme Court. ??The Public Utilities Commission staff also recommended: ??- Deferring $66.1 million of Idaho Power's rate request without interest until answers are available about the company's electricity deals. ??- Deferring another $45.8 million of the request until next year when the commissioners would allow Idaho Power to collect 5-percent interest. That part of the hike was earmarked for wholesale power purchases this year - purchases that the staff believes will be much more expensive next year. ??- Cutting another $10.3 million from the increase request contending it was an error by Idaho Power's Risk Management Committee that the company planned on passing on to ratepayers. ??- Implementing a low-interest loan program to encourage energy conservation by Idaho Power customers. ??- A two-year phase-in of any rate increase ultimately approved that is substantially over 20 percent. ??- Changing residential rates to a three-tiered system to encourage savings. ??Homeowners would pay 5.52 cents per kilowatt-hour for the first 800 kwh used 6.12 cents per kwh for use between 800 kwh and 2000 kwh and 7.48 cents per kwh for use over 2000 kwh. The current residential rate of 5.2 cents per kwh. ??The staff report also took Idaho Power to task saying it was warned of the possibility of spiraling prices and power shortages as far back as 1995. ??But the company contends it did not want to build generating plants during the past decade because with electricity deregulation looming nobody knew what independent power facilities were being considered.

It's obviously way higher than $100 million. ??Natural gas rates at the California border generally tracked national prices until November when they spiked as high as 11 times higher than the price of natural gas elsewhere in the nation Carpenter said. ??I have never seen gas prices like this anywhere in the world said Carpenter who has been studying the energy market for 20 years for Cambridge Mass.-based consultant The Brattle Group. The Brattle Group was hired by Edison to study the natural gas market. ??The committee is one of two legislative committees exploring whether illegal market manipulation in the electricity and natural gas markets has driven up California's energy costs. ??This is a market that is plagued by the exercise of market power Frank Wolak chairman of the California Independent System Operator's Market Surveillance Committee told the Senate Select Committee to Investigate Price Manipulation of the Wholesale Energy Market. The ISO runs the state's power grid. ??However there is no law against me saying 'I'm not going to sell to you' Wolak said. Market manipulation only becomes illegal when there is collusion Wolak said and such evidence is hard to find. ??Electricity generators and natural gas suppliers say a severe supply and demand imbalance - not market manipulation - has led to higher prices. ??Everybody's busy doing investigations. They're not interested in solving the problem said Independent Energy Producers Executive Director Jan Smutny-Jones. ??Investigations are wasting everybody's time Smutny-Jones said adding that previous probes and lawsuits have uncovered no wrongdoing. He said the state's power problems came because state regulators denied utilities the chance to sign long-term energy contracts when they had the chance. ??People have been playing by the rules Smutny-Jones said. ??But the Senate committee's first witnesses are ISO officials who authored studies that claim the state paid more than $6 billion too much for power last year. ??Committee chair Joseph Dunn D-Garden Grove also has slated state Auditor Elaine Howell who last month blamed buyers and sellers for skyrocketing electricity costs. Dunn also has scheduled future testimony from state federal academic and private investigators studying the power market. ??He invited five major generators to attend the committee's second hearing next week. All five - Reliant Dynegy Williams Energy Duke Energy and Mirant - say they are eager to cooperate and clear their names Dunn said. ??Dunn asked the five for a total of 86 specific documents. If the companies feel they cannot provide documents because of legal or confidentiality concerns Dunn said he will subpoena them. ??Smutny-Jones said investigators appear to be growing desperate to blame the state's natural gas and electricity price hikes on illegal market manipulation instead of natural market forces. ??He cited Attorney General Bill Lockyer's announcement last week that any informant who helped prove wrongdoing would be entitled to a percentage of the state's recovery he estimated could range from $50 million to hundreds of millions of dollars. ??If the state's offering a $50 million reward they haven't found anything Smutny-Jones said. I don't think you're going to find the fact that anybody did anything criminal here. ??Assemblywoman Jenny Oropeza D-Long Beach said she believes otherwise after Wednesday's testimony: I think it is very clear there was some price manipulation going on. ??But Assemblyman John Campbell R-Irvine isn't sure there was anything illegal. ??There clearly are market forces at work that's evident Campbell said. Whether you make the jump to market manipulation ... I haven't seen conclusive evidence that leads me to make that jump. LOAD-DATE: April 20 2001,"Energy; California; Politics

679,New Congressional Report on California,Ray Alvarez brought to my attention today a news item indicating that the Congressional Budget Office released a report earlier this week entitled Causes and Lessons of the California Electricity Crisis. The 30+ page report is available on the home page of the CBO's web site at www.cbo.gov. I have quickly read through the summary and it is largely favorable. For example the summary says: Much of the blame for California's electricity crisis attaches to the state's restructuring plan -- but not to its objective electricity deregulation. (...) But deregulation itself did not fail rather it was never achieved. The restructuring plan did not remove sufficient barriers on both the supply and demand sides of the market to allow competition to work -- in part because it was not designed to. Even without restructuring California's electric utilities would have faced a difficult challenge in meeting the demand for power and holding down prices in 2000. Consequently wholesale electricity prices were higher than they probably would have been in either a traditionally regulated market or a more fully deregulated market. Long-term solutions to California's electricity problems will most likely require three changes: removing barriers to the addition of generating capacity eliminating bottlenecks in the electricity transmission system and removing regulatory restrictions on the sale of power throughout the broad western market. On the negative side the report summary does state that some generators may also have withheld supplies at certain times to boost prices even more and the plan's auction system for the spot market appears to have created strong incentives for suppliers to bid strategically in a way that raised wholesale prices.,"California; Electricity; Deregulation; Report

680,Legislative Update -- Two Track In The Senate and House Update,We face two parallel tracks in the Senate in the coming weeks between now and the start of the congressional recess for one week on June 29th. In the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee we will be facing efforts by pro-price caps forces who will use the committee bully pulpit to pressure FERC into more action. This effort is led by incoming chairman Bingaman with support from Majority Leader Daschle. They are saying they will consider acting on the Feinstein-Smith price cap legislation unless FERC takes unspecified additional action by the end of this month. The new track in the Senate will be in the Governmental Affairs Committee chaired by Sen. Lieberman (D-CT). While this committee does not have the legislative jurisdiction over energy that the Energy Committee does in terms of moving legislation the Governmental Affairs Committee has broad oversight and investigatory jurisdiction over all federal agencies including FERC. New chairman Lieberman held his first press conference as chairman today and said addressing high energy prices would be a priority. In that vein the committee is expected to hold a hearing on June 13 featuring some of the economists who wrote a letter in favor of price caps last month. We are checking with the Republican staff to make sure that the anti-price cap economists (the majority of the discipline of course) will also testify. We also brief committee members and staff with our arguments against price caps and the latest publicly available market data. On June 20 the committee will hold a hearing on whether FERC has properly exercised its duties under the Federal Power Act to make sure that wholesale power rates are just and reasonable. We are going to meet with the committee majority staff but we presently expect this hearing to have political witnesses (i.e. elected officials possibly including Gov. Davis). We must keep in mind that Sen. Feinstein had earlier written to Chairman Lieberman asking for a hearing on the California energy situation including relationships between FERC and those it regulates (citing the NY Times article involving Enron and Chairman Hebert). There is at present no indicationi that either hearing will address this matter. We are as you might imagine paying close attention to this situation. Over in the House Energy and Commerce Chairman Tauzin has said he will write to FERC asking them to extend the April 26 price mitigation order to the entire west and to extend it to 24/7. He also asks FERC to see if it can implement negawatts demand reduction administratively. We are in the process of obtaining a copy of the letter which has not yet been made public. Also in the House we expect congressional committees to begin marking up portions of the President's energy legislation and related topics as the month unfolds.,"Energy; Legislation; FERC

695,FTC Staff Report on Electricity Restructuring,Yesterday the Federal Trade Commission issued a staff report on electricity restructuring issues. It is an update of the July 2000 report done at the request of House Energy Chairman Tauzin and Subcommittee Chairman Barton. They requested the report be updated. A summary of the report and the full 80+ page text is on the FTC web site at www.ftc.gov on the upper left side of the home page. I read the summary and will read the balance. So far so good. It basically says that even states that have opened up to retail competition are in transition with a hybrid of regulation and competition thus the expected benefits of competition have not yet emerged. However the report states that nothing to date indicates that competition once the transition period is over will not produce additional benefits for consumers. The report's major conclusion is that competitive wholesale markets are important to achieving effective competition in retail markets. The summary includes something that sounds promising on RTO policy saying And as wholesale and retail markets become regional governing policies and jurisdictional approaches also must move in that direction for wholesale and retail competition to be successful.,"Electricity; Restructuring; FTC; Competition; RTOs

By Kevin Yamamura Bee Capitol Bureau (Published July 6 2001) Two more former workers from a Duke Energy power plant came forward Thursday to bolster recent claims by colleagues that the power generator withheld production to drive up prices. But Duke attributed witness accounts of fluctuating generation to instructions from the state's transmission-grid operator. Richard J. Connors an auxiliary operator and E. Robert Edwards an electrician said generation units at Duke's Chula Vista plant sat idle during emergency periods for no apparent reason. Three of their former co-workers -- two mechanics and a control room operator -- told lawmakers two weeks ago that Duke had disposed of new parts and varied its production. While that testimony drew significant attention it was countered Monday by a report released by the state's Independent System Operator that showed the ISO had in fact ordered Duke's up-and-down output Jan. 16-18. On Thursday the Charlotte N.C.-based company leaned on the ISO report in its defense. The ISO could have dispatched those units at will said Duke spokesman Tom Williams referring to unused equipment. But Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante who has filed a lawsuit against generators contended that the ISO had based its orders on Duke's dubious bidding history. These ISO orders came only after Duke had continuously manipulated the market with price-gouging schemes forcing the ISO to regulate production Bustamante said. Connors and Edwards each worked more than 20 years at the South Bay plant in Chula Vista. For most of that time the plant was owned by San Diego Gas & Electric. Two years ago Duke purchased South Bay and retained Connors and Edwards under state-mandated agreements that ended in April. Edwards said that during power blackouts in January he saw a 225-megawatt unit off-line. Other units he said were operating far below capacity. Our No. 1 priority in life was to make money Edwards said. Williams rebutted the claims as observations from those who did not have the complete picture. It's dead on dead true that there are times when that plant is not running at full capacity and there is a Stage 3 Williams said. There may be blackouts in San Francisco. But the reason why it's not running is because the power can't move up Path 15 (a north-south bottleneck). Bustamante however maintained that Duke has continued to manipulate the market calling Connors and Edwards the tip of the iceberg in the price-gouging investigation. State Sen. Joe Dunn D-Santa Ana chairman of the Senate committee investigating price manipulation said Connors and Edwards may testify before lawmakers after further evaluation. Dunn added that his committee has talked to potential whistleblowers from other power generators who said they have seen production decreases and suspicious activities. It is undetermined whether they will testify he said. The Bee's Kevin Yamamura can be reached at (916) 326-5542 or kyamamura@sacbee.com. Lockyer seeks SEC investigation of PG&E's financial transfers By Ed Fletcher Bee Capitol Bureau (Published July 6 2001) State Attorney General Bill Lockyer on Thursday asked the federal Securities and Exchange Commission to scrutinize financial transfers made to PG&E Corp. from its subsidiary that has filed for bankruptcy protection. SEC scrutiny is essential to protect the public interest ratepayers and the people of the state of California Lockyer said in a prepared statement. Charges that PG&E Corp. hastened the bankruptcy filing of Pacific Gas and Electric Co. have been made before responded Greg Pruett a vice president of PG&E Corp. That is an issue that has been investigated multiple times by the Public Utilities Commission earlier this year by an Assembly oversight committee and in each of these audits there has been no conclusion that the transfers were inappropriate or that they were injurious to PG&E Co. Pruett said. In its filing with the SEC the attorney general's office said that without meaningful review by the SEC it cannot be determined what impact the transfer of assets ... may have on the financial condition of the bankrupt utility. An SEC spokesman said the commission has yet to examine the petition. Among other concerns raised by Lockyer's office is the transfer of more than $4 billion from 1997 to 1999 to PG&E Corp. from PG&E Co. The majority of the $4 billion came from the sales of PG&E power plants as was required by deregulation. The bulk of the money went to pay debt that was incurred to actually build those plants Pruett said. The rest of the transfers were to pay stockholder dividends he said. PG&E filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in April after having run up $6.6 billion in debt. The Bee's Ed Fletcher can be reached at (916) 326-5548 or efletcher@sacbee.com. Business Financial Desk California State Seeks SEC Probe of PG&E Transfers NANCY RIVERA BROOKS ? 07/06/2001 Los Angeles Times Home Edition Page C-2 Copyright 2001 / The Times Mirror Company California Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer on Thursday asked the Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate PG&E Corp. for potential abuses of its responsibilities as a utility holding company. At issue is a series of transactions over the last several years in which PG&E Corp. transferred funds from its utility Pacific Gas & Electric Co. which now is operating under Bankruptcy Court protection. The money--more than $4 billion since 1997--flowed to the parent company and to unregulated sister companies of the utilities. The transfers have been scrutinized by the California Public Utilities Commission and the state Legislature with no finding of wrongdoing said PG&E Corp. spokesman Greg S. Pruett. The SEC currently exempts PG&E from almost all requirements of the Public Utility Holding Company Act because the San Francisco utility operates primarily within California . That law regulates transactions between holding companies and their utility subsidiaries. Lockyer wants the SEC to withdraw PG&E's exemption citing $13 billion in PG&E assets outside of California . All the primary evils addressed by PUHCA are relevant to PG&E Corp. Lockyer's petition to the SEC stated. In Bankruptcy Court on Thursday PG&E said it is close to reaching an agreement with Calpine Corp. to pay more than $267 million it owes the San Jose-based power generator and to preserve contracts for 453 megawatts of relatively cheap electricity . In all PG&E buys about 2600 megawatts of electricity from nearly 25 alternative generators which are seeking repayment and release from their contracts through Bankruptcy Court. National Desk THE NATION Little Progress on Energy Rebate Judge Hints RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR ? 07/06/2001 Los Angeles Times Home Edition Page A-30 Copyright 2001 / The Times Mirror Company WASHINGTON -- The federal mediator seeking a settlement for billions of dollars in alleged electricity overcharges in California signaled Thursday that the talks are in trouble and analysts said hope for a deal seems to be fading. Curtis L. Wagner Jr. chief judge of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission said he may issue a report on the closed-door talks as early as today if he sees no progress. The judge will perhaps issue a preliminary assessment of the talks said Tamara Young-Allen a spokeswoman for FERC. He will do this only if he feels the talks aren't moving along as he sees fit. Originally a preliminary report from the judge was not part of the plan. Wagner had previously said all sides would labor in private through the weekend to try to get a deal by Monday's midnight deadline. If that failed the judge said he would take seven days to craft a proposed settlement for FERC's governing board. Kit Konolige a power industry analyst with Morgan Stanley in New York said Wagner's announcement on Thursday amounted to a judicial distress signal. The judge wouldn't say something like this if the parties were close to a settlement said Konolige. I suppose he may be trying to jump-start things but I think most people believed the sides were so far apart going into the talks that it seemed like a long way to go to reach a settlement. Although Wagner has imposed a gag order on participants several people with knowledge of the negotiations said Thursday that major power generators and California officials have not budged from dug-in positions since the talks began last week. They also said the judge is extremely frustrated with the state and with several large power suppliers. California is demanding $9 billion in refunds. According to sources the generators have offered less than $1 billion. And some major power sellers are insisting they do not owe anything. Many experts say California has little hope of obtaining the $9 billion since only $5.4 billion of that is attributable to sellers under FERC's jurisdiction. On the other hand it seems clear from statements by FERC commissioners that the board is prepared to extract significant refunds from generators. Wagner is said to be probing for a compromise figure between $1 billion and $9 billion. It could take the form of a mix of cash payments and discounts on long-term contracts for power. FERC's governing board ordered Wagner to hold the talks to see if a compromise could be struck on three big issues: refunds guarantees that generators will be paid and ways to shift more of the state's power purchases to long-term contracts. The board also made clear that it would impose its own settlement if the state and power sellers were unable to come to an agreement. Wagner said Thursday that if he issues a preliminary report today he will give all the parties a chance to respond publicly on Monday. Such a report might embarrass some of the key players since Wagner is known for his plain-spoken conclusions. The judge would then prepare a settlement recommendation for the FERC board by July 16. However he also said he is willing to work through the weekend to reach a settlement if it appears within striking distance. The talks are in a large hearing room on the second floor of the FERC building near Washington's Union Station. Access is strictly controlled and special badges have been issued to the more than 140 lawyers participating. Some people with knowledge of the negotiations said Wagner's threat to issue a report may be a bid to see if one of the parties will make a move. It was like a shot across the bow said one source. * RELATED STORIES Energy savers: College students help businesses cut waste. B1 SEC probe: The state urges a review of PG&E fund transfers.

Gray Davis even though one of the consultants dropped his Southern California Edison contract amid conflict-of- interest allegations. Mark Fabiani and Chris Lehane were collectively known as the Masters of Disaster for their work in the Clinton White House during various federal investigations. They also worked for Vice President Al Gore during the 2000 presidential campaign. Because of their work for Davis Connell says the contract Fabiani and Lehane signed with Edison is a conflict of interest under state ethics rules. Davis is negotiating with Edison on a bailout for the utility. Late last week at the bottom of a press release Davis announced that Fabiani was no longer a communications consultant because his work had been successfully implemented. Lehane on the other hand has dropped his contract with Edison and signed a new agreement with Davis. Lehane's new contract includes reimbursement for travel and meal expenses which he didn't have before and requires him to work a maximum of 66 hours a month at $150 an hour. His total payments are capped at $76000 for work from June 26 to Nov. 20 2001. In his release Davis said Lehane would be paid the same amount as former communications director Phil Trounstine about $9900 a month. But Connell like Davis a Democrat said Trounstine undoubtedly worked more than 66 hours in a month for his $9990. We don't intend to be paying it Connell said of the contract for both men. They represented Southern California Edison. You have to have a singular relationship with the state of California and not show a conflict. Previously the Davis administration said there was no conflict because Edison and Davis wanted the same things out of their negotiations. Earlier this week Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said attorneys had different opinions over whether the two consultants had violated ethics rules. Davis spokeswoman Hilary McLean said the governor had signed an executive order allowing him to enter into consulting contracts with anyone he believed could help him solve the state's energy crisis. She said Lehane had been working full-time on public policy even though his contract caps his salary. The National Tax-Limitation Committee a Sacramento group that mostly monitors legislation sued last month alleging that Fabiani and Lehane were violating the state Political Reform Act because of the Edison contract. In a recently filed disclosure statement Fabiani also listed more than $10 000 worth of consulting work for Cisco Systems another company that frequently brings issues before state authorities including Davis. The state Fair Political Practices Commission also is looking into a complaint filed by GOP Secretary of State Bill Jones that Fabiani and Lehane violated state ethics rules.

Page?A - 3 Ex-staff speaks out against Duke Two more charge prices manipulated Robert Salladay Chronicle Sacramento Bureau Friday July 6 2001 2001 San Francisco Chronicle URL: N122949.DTL Sacramento -- Two more former employees at Duke Energy's Chula Vista power plant came forward yesterday with allegations that the company manipulated the energy market to drive up prices although they offered no hard proof and little new information. Their accusations bring to five the number of Duke plant workers who say they observed suspicious behavior including the disappearance of parts needed for repairs the idling of generators for no apparent reason and continual stopping and starting that critics of Duke suspect was designed to withhold power and artificially increase prices. E. Robert Edwards a 50-year-old electrician related one conversation with a Duke foreman sometime in January that prompted suspicion. I asked the foreman why Unit 4 wasn't running Edwards said yesterday at a press conference. We had a 225-megawatt generator sitting there and he just shrugged his shoulders and said 'I really can't tell you. I'm not privy to that information.'  State lawmakers have been focusing on whether Duke manipulated prices during three days in January when the company at one point offered a single megawatt of power for a record-shattering $3880. Duke says it was following orders from the Independent System Operator which runs the state's power grid when it repeatedly turned its generators on and off during those three days. An ISO memo recently released by Duke confirms the company's contention it was under orders. But January logs from the ISO and the generators don't offer an explanation for every allegation of price manipulation since Duke has refused to release a detailed list of the prices it offered and paid during that period. The two workers who came forward yesterday Edwards and 46-year-old Richard J. Connors both worked more than 20 years in the business. They left the South Bay Plant in Chula Vista in April two years after Duke purchased it from San Diego Gas & Electric as part of deregulation. SOME SHIFTS UNPOPULAR It is true units were taken offline mostly on the weekends for whatever reason said Connors a former auxiliary operator. It got to the point as an operator that you were dreading working swing shifts on Sunday or graveyard Monday morning because you knew you were going to be running around putting units back online. Edwards said he had seen a company warehouse eventually emptied of parts that are used to repair broken generators although he didn't know where the parts went. Forcing a longer wait for repair parts was designed to dry up the power supply and push prices higher lawmakers and other investigators suspect. Edwards however admitted the warehouse was being cleaned out even when SDG&E ran the plant. Duke contends the workers weren't familiar with Duke's inventory system and couldn't possibly know why parts were being moved. Duke and other energy companies are facing scrutiny by two legislative committees a 19-member Sacramento County grand jury state Attorney General Bill Lockyer the California Public Utilities Commission and federal regulators. BUSTAMANTE ALSO SUING Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante who introduced Edwards and Connors yesterday also is suing a variety of generators in state court for alleged price manipulation and bad business practices. He said Edwards and Connors reiterated what we've know all along -- Duke has been gouging California consumers through its use and abuse of the South Bay Plant. Duke offers a variety of defenses for its actions during the three days in January and throughout the energy crisis. Tom Williams a spokesman for Duke said Edwards and Connors had offered nothing new yesterday. Beyond the ISO's 37 separate orders to stop and start generators during the three days in January Williams said state air regulations required the company to shut the plant at certain times because it was running out of emissions credits that limit the amount of air pollution it can put out. Duke which controls about 5 percent of the state energy market also contends the state's power transmission lines can't always handle an increase in load. Yes it's true there are times when that plant is not running at full capacity and there is a Stage Three (alert) and there may be blackouts in San Francisco Williams said. The reason why it's not running is the power cannot move up Path 15 the transmission line bottleneck near Los Banos.

Johnson Chronicle Staff Writer Friday July 6 2001 2001 San Francisco Chronicle URL: N138966.DTL Vallejo leaders looking to escape mounting gas and electric bills are planning to build enough new power generators that the city government will be self-sufficient when it comes to energy. City officials said they believe that Vallejo is the first city in the nation to take such an approach. This is going to be a showplace said Scott Sossen the chief executive officer of Edge Capital Group a funding agency based in Orange County. Edge will be supervising the work along with O'Hara Energy Corp. of Nevada. The plan comes at a time when the city expects to see its energy costs double next year if it continues buying its power from PG&E. It couldn't be more timely said Mayor Tony Intintoli. Vallejo leaders are in the process of contracting with private business to build new wind solar and microturbine generators. Construction of a one- megawatt solar generator could start within 30 to 60 days. Conservation is also part of the plan and energy-efficiency improvements are already under way at Vallejo City Hall and the fire and police stations. City officials hope to add enough sources of power generation to make all city offices -- which consume about 10 megawatts a year -- self-sufficient by the end of the year. The Vallejo City Council gave tentative approval to the project late last month and will continue its discussions on the plan next week. Vallejo taxpayers won't have to pay any money in advance because Edge will finance the project's first $50 million in capital costs. In return a portion of the city's projected financial savings will be shared with the Edge and O'Hara. This is a fairly sizable project said Kevin Chambers the chief executive officer at O'Hara. Energy-efficient capital is difficult to find because it is such a new field. O'Hara is installing high-tech energy management systems at all city-owned property to reduce energy consumption. Final sites for the construction of new wind solar and microturbine generators have not been chosen. In recent years the energy bill for Vallejo city government has averaged between $2 million and $3 million per year. That includes the police and fire departments City Hall and water-pumping stations. Vallejo is part of a group of 50 local governments in Northern California that pooled their resources to buy electricity and natural gas keeping prices down. But the group's current contract expires Dec. 30. As a result the city expects its energy bill to double next year from 9.2 cents per kilowatt hour to 20 cents per kilowatt hour. It's been very positive what we've been doing and it hasn't cost us anything said City Manager David Martinez. We're going to be very optimistic that this is going to be a good thing for the city. City officials hope to eventually extend the plan to Vallejo's 4500 businesses and 37000 households. E-mail Jason B. Johnson at jbjohnson@sfchronicle.com. 2001 San Francisco Chronicle ? Page?A - 23 SEC asked to see if PG&E Corp. violated law with subsidiary Published Friday July 6 2001 in the San Jose Mercury News BY JENNIFER BJORHUS Mercury News California Attorney General Bill Lockyer asked the federal Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday to step in to investigate whether PG&E Corp. violated federal law in taking billions of dollars from its bankrupt subsidiary. ``SEC scrutiny is essential to protect the public interest ratepayers and the people of the state of California'' Lockyer said in a statement. More than $4 billion flowed from the Pacific Gas & Electric utility to parent PG&E Corp. from 1997 to 1999 according to Lockyer's petition representing nearly 70 percent of the cash that flowed to the parent company during that period. PG&E Corp. spent $2.7 billion to buy back its stock $1.5 billion to pay dividends to shareholders and invested $800 million in its other subsidiaries according to the petition filed Thursday in Washington. Those figures are similar to figures from a state-ordered independent audit of PG&E Corp.'s finances released in late January. By moving assets from the utility to other businesses the company potentially harmed the utility and violated the federal Public Utility Holding Company Act in several ways according to the petition. The SEC is the nation's top cop for publicly held companies. But the commission has not reviewed PG&E Corp.'s asset movements saying the company is exempt from scrutiny under the Public Utility Holding Company Act because it's mainly a California operation and such intrastate operations are exempt. The attorney general's office argues that PG&E Corp. with more than $13 billion of its assets outside the state can no longer claim it is primarily an intrastate company. The SEC should step in it argues. The petition surprised PG&E Corp. officials who said they had no idea the attorney general's office had an issue with the company's exemption from the federal law said company spokesman Greg Pruett. Pruett said PG&E Corp.'s actions were appropriate because the federal utility law only applies if a company has one or more of the following activities in several states: electric transmission and distribution gas distribution or utility-owned generation. ``We have none of those things except in California'' Pruett said adding that the National Energy Group a PG&E Corp. affiliate ``has natural gas transmission but no distribution.'' ``The power plants that NEG owns or operates are not part of a utility and thus aren't regulated by PUCHA and it has an energy-trading arm that is also not regulated by PUCHA'' he said. The petition further asks the SEC to order PG&E Corp. to cooperate fully with the California Public Utilities Commission. The state commission is investigating whether PG&E Corp.'s corporate structure and its relationship with its bankrupt utility violate state utility regulations. The petition states it expects a response from the SEC within 60 days. But SEC spokesman John Heine said there's no statutory deadline for a response. He said he had not seen the petition and could not comment. Contact Jennifer Bjorhus at jbjorhus@sjmercury.com or (408) 920-5660.

Davis keeps state addicted to fossil fuels Published Friday July 6 2001 in the San Jose Mercury News BY JOE COSTELLO BEFORE this year's energy ``crisis'' Gray Davis wanted to be known as the education governor. However Davis and his advisers' energy teachings have revealed alarming failures setting back state energy policy not one or two years but one or two decades. While George W. Bush proposed an energy policy tied to fossil fuels disproportionate building of centralized generation plants too little energy efficiency lowering environmental standards and increased global warming emissions Davis enacted it. First Davis has tied the state for the next decade or longer to contracts with facilities that are exclusively fossil fuel generation. Second he has encouraged an unprecedented surge in the building of new centralized fossil fuel plants. Finally he has pushed the lowering of environmental standards to increase production from the dirtiest fossil fuel facilities. The state's new energy purchasing department has spent zero on renewable generation. David Freeman the governor's energy czar giving lip service to alternatives has negotiated close to $50 billion in long-term contracts with fossil fuel generators. By comparison the governor has authorized investment of only $13 million in expanding solar generation. Photovoltaic cells produce electricity directly from the sun's energy offering a clean efficient solution to the state's future peak energy demand. While the governor talks a lot about energy efficiency the state's funding of demand programs is about 1 percent of the funding for supply. Most egregious the vast majority of state energy efficiency money is funneled back to the utilities. While environmentalists deride the Bush administration proposals in California organizations such as the Natural Resources Defense Council actively support Davis' fossil fuel energy policy. The Davis energy policy has stuck California with the same old electric system for at least the next decade. Money has literally been burned instead of invested in innovation and creation of a cleaner and more efficient system. The best hedge against price spikes is a diversity of fuel sources unfortunately California's electric system is now tied to an even greater degree to fossil fuels. After binding the state economy to the past the Davis end game is logical. Davis and his energy advisers want to spend tens of billions of dollars for the utilities' restoration -- the very companies that for so long stifled industry innovation and remain most responsible for California's energy fiasco. There is still an opportunity to make the best out of a bad situation. Instead of bailing out the utilities they should be dismantled and sold off. A combination of a dozen or so local government and publicly owned companies should be created with a goal of innovating the industry. An auction could be held that would sell customer blocks and with it the state's long-term contracts. Choice should be reinstated with the lifting of the suspension on direct access to alternative suppliers. Instead of moving the state to the next level of energy development the education governor's remedial energy teachings will force California to repeat its energy lessons.

Business Economics fuels power solution in California Price relief gains political support Robert Gibbons BridgeNews ? 07/06/2001 Chicago Tribune North Sports Final  N Page 3 (Copyright 2001 by the Chicago Tribune) Political pressure coming from the U.S. Congress and politicians from Western states seems to have influenced the approach to the power crisis despite opposition to price caps in the Bush administration. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in June expanded price mitigation measures on wholesale electricity sales in California during periods when blackouts are possible. The measures encourage generators to sell power into the state to prevent emergency alerts from being declared which trigger price caps. The move came with support growing in Congress especially among representatives of Western states on both sides of the aisle for legislation that would have capped wholesale prices in the region. The macroeconomic force may have been the difference between the $7 billion cost of power for California in 1999 and its rise to approximately $27 billion in 2000. The cost is estimated to reach between $50 billion and $70 billion in 2001. With that kind of money at stake suddenly the concern becomes less a question of who is responsible for the problem but rather how it can be solved quickly to prevent harsh political consequences. California Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer has conducted an investigation into the actions of power generators and offered multimillion dollar rewards to whistleblowers to provide evidence of price manipulation by independent power generators. The state is seeking refunds of $8.9 billion the amount it estimates independent power generators overcharged California 's troubled utilities. The U.S. General Accounting Office has released a report criticizing the FERC for not finding evidence of power generators using plant outages to drive up prices in California . FERC's [February] study was not thorough enough to support its overall conclusion that audited companies were not physically withholding electricity supply to influence prices the GAO found. Of the major independent power generators and marketers like Reliant Energy Dynegy Duke Energy and Enron only Williams and its CEO Keith Bailey came out in April in favor of some sort of short- term price relief for California . The political dynamic out there is much more Draconian than what we're proposing Bailey told analysts in April defending Williams' position supporting some limited short-term price mitigation. What he was worried about was California Gov. Gray Davis using eminent domain powers to take over power plants and the state setting up a public power authority to build state-owned plants. Financial California Changes Stance on Refunds Two Sides Far Apart In Energy Talks Peter Behr ? 07/06/2001 The Washington Post FINAL Page E01 Copyright 2001 The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved California officials have abruptly shifted tactics in their attempt to recover billions of dollars in alleged overcharges for electricity  saying they may reduce their demands for huge refunds if generators renegotiate $43 billion in long-term electricity contracts that the state signed this year. Gov. Gray Davis (D) said part of the $8.9 billion in refunds the state is seeking could be offset by reductions in energy prices in the long-term contracts whose costs have become a growing political embarrassment for Davis. We've made suggestions we've offered various ways in which people could get us $8.9 billion Davis told the San Jose Mercury News in a report yesterday. You can renegotiate our existing contracts and save us money. However you want to do it it's just got to net out close to $8.9 billion. The new offer was introduced this week into the closed negotiations over a California settlement being conducted in Washington by Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Judge Curtis L. Wagner Jr. according to sources close to the negotiations. Yesterday Wagner said he may issue his own preliminary finding today on the amount of overcharges if California officials and the generators cannot reach a compromise. What I'm trying to do is get people in a settlement mood Wagner told reporters. In the event we're unable to do that [Friday] at some point I may offer a preliminary assessment. The settlement conference is set to conclude on Monday. Wagner FERC's chief administrative judge has been trying to push both sides toward a compromise that would resolve the huge energy pricing controversy. Mountainous energy prices have bankrupted California 's largest utility drained billions of dollars out of the state treasury and put Davis at sword's point with generators that help keep the state's lights on. Last Friday Wagner rebuked Davis's chief representative Michael Kahn chairman of California Independent Grid Operator -- the state's power grid manager -- indicating that the state's demand for nearly $9 billion in refunds from power generators and marketers was too high sources said. Wagner's settlement conference which has involved more than 100 lawyers for all sides is closed to the public and media. Wagner complained last month that Kahn was following a political agenda and his lack of independence in the negotiations was such a joke that the parties might as well wear clown suits according to a Dow Jones report confirmed by sources close to the talks. But he has also criticized the generators and power marketers led by Reliant Energy Inc. Williams Energy Services Duke Energy and Southern Co. for failing to make serious settlement offers these sources said. The suppliers have offered to refund $600 million provided the state is able to call off various California lawsuits demanding far larger refunds sources said. Wagner's leverage is his ability to propose his own refund figure to FERC's commissioners. FERC has tentatively called for $124 million in refunds but now is taking a harder line on preventing a new escalation of California 's electricity prices this summer and is likely to be receptive to a higher refund figure some energy analysts believe. Davis's tactical change offering to make the long-term contracts part of an overall settlement comes amid growing criticism of what the state will have to pay for energy under those deals. California 's energy calamity stemmed in large part from its failed deregulation plan which relied heavily on short-term power purchases at volatile spot market prices. When energy costs shot upward last summer so did the state's electricity bills. In response Davis's aide S. David Freeman and his staff began negotiating long-term power contacts with suppliers. The $43 billion in deals signed so far would require the state to pay about $70 per hour for a megawatt of power for a large part of the electricity it will need over the next 10 years. That's well under the average of $250 per megawatt-hour that the state was paying at the beginning of this year but above current power prices -- and considerably higher than what electricity may cost in the next decade energy analysts say. A new agreement to lower those contract prices could relieve political pressure on Davis and focus settlement negotiations away from the state's controversial demand for the $8.9 billion refund. Davis will argue that reducing future power charges that his administration negotiated should count as a refund because the deals were reached under commercial duress according to sources close to Wagner's negotiations. Industry supporters say Davis's refund figure is impossible to justify. There's no benchmark for what a fair and reasonable price should be said Michael Zenger California director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates. The state's advocates counter that if FERC enforced a just and reasonable standard for power prices based on operating costs and a generous profit the overcharges by all sellers could easily reach the $9 billion figure. It's not rocket science but it does require the regulators to regulate said Frank Wolak a Stanford University economist who heads an oversight committee for the California grid. Those polar-opposite views have left both sides in Wagner's conference room billions of dollars apart as the talks approached their final weekend sources said. http://www.washingtonpost.com Contact: http://www.washingtonpost.com Politics & Policy U.S. Hearing Officer May Impose Pact To End California Power-Overcharge Case By Richard B. Schmitt ? 07/06/2001 The Wall Street Journal Page A10 (Copyright (c) 2001 Dow Jones & Company Inc.) WASHINGTON -- With settlement talks apparently stalled a federal hearing officer said he may propose his own solution to settle billions in alleged electricity overcharges tied to the California power crisis. Curtis L. Wagner Jr. said he was still optimistic California officials and several power companies could come to terms on $8.9 billion in disputed electricity charges the state has incurred over the past year. Absent more-meaningful progress he said he would offer his own preliminary assessment and recommendation as soon as today. In that event Mr. Wagner also said he would convene a hearing Monday where the two sides would be given the chance to comment on his plans. Mr. Wagner has previously indicated he feels California is due some refunds but far less than the total the state claims. California is also indebted to the power companies for billions in previous deliveries those debts could at least partially offset any refunds. Mr. Wagner has also said long-term contracts that would insulate the state from the sort of price shocks it has experienced over the past year could be part of any resolution. An administrative-law judge with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Mr. Wagner was named by the panel two weeks ago to broker a peace of the overcharge dispute. Commission officials have given the parties until Monday to reach an agreement behind closed doors. After that absent a settlement the commission has ordered Mr. Wagner to report back with his findings and recommendations within a week. At that point the commission has said it will impose a settlement of its own liking. The overcharge issue has been a flash point in the California debacle with the state's governor Gray Davis calling the energy companies pirates and marauders. The industry considers itself a scapegoat for a bungled state deregulation effort.,"Energy; California; PG&E; SEC

700,Fw: CONFIDENTIAL AND PRIVILEGED ATTORNEY-CLIENT COMMUNICATION,The CAISO recently filed Amendment 30 which would provide the CAISO with the authority to engage in forward contracts/purchasing etc. to meet reliability requirements. This filing is in response to the language in the FERC San Diego Order which suggested that the FERC believes the CAISO should have this authority. Clearly this raises issues about the role of the CAISO in the forward markets as a policy matter but FERC is likely to approved this authority anyway. The CAISO Board is addressing this matter as part of its Comprehensive Market Reform Project. The CAISO Board at the September 7 meeting deferred the issues of the 2-day ahead market (as well as the policy matter of the CAISO buying forward) until the October meeting. However later during Executive Session the CAISO Board apparently approved Amendment 30. At this point in time IEP is not planning on responding to Amendment 30. This position is primarily driven by limited funds in the Restructuring/Transmission Task Force account and given the forces aligned in support taking this issue up seem problematic. Please let me know if anyone differs with this assessment and would like to see IEP comment (recognizing that funds would be required to accomplish this). ----- Original Message ----- From: Andy Brown <ABB@eslawfirm.com> To: Steven Kelly (E-mail) <steven@iepa.com> Katie Kaplan (E-mail) <kaplan@iepa.com> <smutny@iepa.com> Cc: Douglas Kerner <DKK@eslawfirm.com> Chris Ellison <CTE@eslawfirm.com> Eric Janssen <EricJ@eslawfirm.com> Sent: Monday September 18 2000 3:55 PM Subject: CONFIDENTIAL AND PRIVILEGED ATTORNEY-CLIENT COMMUNICATION > Attached is a memo which briefly describes CAISO's Amendment 30 and a > potential response approach for IEP.

715,Todays Senate Hearing,The Senate Governmental Affairs Committee held an unusually long hearing today (9:30 am to 4:30 pm) on FERC's responses to the California situation and other related energy issues. The star witness was Gov. Davis. Others were Govs. Martz of Montana and Hoeven of North Dakota against price caps Sens. Murkowski Murray and Cantwell Washington State's attorney general Oregon's PUC chairman and the five FERC commissioners. Once Davis left after several hours of testimony and two rounds of questions most of the press and audience left. Enron was mentioned several times as follows: 1. Sen. Thompson the Ranking Republican mentioned Lockyer's Spike comments in the context of asking Gov. Davis about why business would make new investments in the state when on top of the regulatory uncertainty there is the broader political hostility expressed in this way by state officials. Davis had two chances to disavow Lockyer and did not. (Thompson gave him a second chance when he basically repeated the question and made specific reference again to Spike asking Davis if FERC acted this week because of the AG's Spike comments.) The first time Davis said that the people he represents are mad they want him to fight back this is rough business the industry people are used to a wildcatter's environment things occassionally get out of hand and we are not going to take it. On the second instance he said that the state was building new power plants and investment was not being diminished. 2. Sen. Bennett (R-UT) did an excellent job questioning Gov. Davis about his handling of the situation using quotes from California newspapers to make the case that Davis was slow to act. He also argued that the state had done a bad job as a power purchaser contrasting the state's recent 8-year contract with Constellation for power at $150 peak and $59 off-peak with Enron's willingness last year to sell them power for five years at $50. The Republicans also pressed Davis on why he attacks out-of-state generators but is not nearly as vocal about California munis who charged even more. Davis said they should make refunds too. 3. While not saying Enron by name Gov. Davis did make a comment about companies with trading floors that compete with the New York Stock Exchange with meteorologists and very talented people who might have the ability to find loopholes in the new order. He said this in answer to a question about what FERC needed to do now that the new order was issued and he said watch out for manipulation by those subject to the order. 4. Sen. Thompson pressed Washington State AG Gregoire about why she appeared to be investigating out-of-state suppliers even though they had a small percentage of the market in her state with lots of document requests and other investigative action while not doing the same to others. During that exchange either Thompson or the AG (I think it was the AG) said Enron had over $1 billion in sales to Washington State. Enron was not on the list of companies Thompson or the AG said were subject to her information demands. She said she would be expanding her inquiry though. Highlights and Analysis 1. As started at yesterday's Senate Energy hearing the mantra from the Western Democrats was: we want our money back. Chairman Lieberman and others pressed FERC about how California could get refunds and the same in other Western states particularly Oregon and Washington. Chairman Hebert said that the settlement conference process would allow all parties to raise all issues including refunds in California and outside California. He said that the conference could include issues that the commission could not act on itself including refunds not otherwise allowed under the Federal Power Act. Chairman Lieberman vowed to keep the committee active in overseeing FERC's activities in implementing the new order particularly as it relates to refunds. While he acknowledged that new legislation could not apply to pending cases he seemed inclined to pursue legislation to repeal the 60 day delay in the Federal Power Act relating to refunds. 2. Commissioner Wood spoke of the need to increase the penalities and enforcement tools available to the commission including the ability to order short suspensions of authority for regulated entities to transact business treble damages and other administrative penalties. There was also discussion among the committee and commissioners about beefing up FERC's market monitoring capabilities so that it acted more like the SEC FCC and FTC than it has in the past. 3. The Democrats on the committee and among the witnesses said that FERC's latest order is a step in the right direction. None of them called for legislative action on price caps as proposed by Sens. Feinstein and Smith. Sen. Murkowski had done a good job of taking the wind out of the legislated price cap sails by saying at the start of the hearing when he testified that the bill's sponsors had pulled back from swift action when they spoke at yesterday's hearing. Davis did say the still thinks that cost-based rates are better but he said the new order is some price relief and that it corrected the mistakes in the April order. 4. There was some discussion of natural gas again. Davis said that FERC should now turn its attention to natural gas. He said that El Paso controlled too much of the capacity until recently. He called on FERC to enforce laws against price manipulation. (Note: we have had several back channel reports that the Lieberman committee intends to look into the El Paso and Williams cases now at FERC about alleged affiliate issues.) 5. There was some discussion of the termination of the new FERC order. Lieberman pressed several witnesses about whether Sept. 2002 is too soon. Davis said it was and that they needed at least until the end of 2002 if not more time and that order should apply until California has enough new generation in place. Hebert did not back down when pressed by Lieberman later in the hearing saying there needs to be a deadline to get action on new supplies however he and the others basically said they would revisit the issue if events warrant. 6. Several times Sen. Lieberman and others said they generally support deregulation but that the effort to get more states to do so will never happen if the price situation is not brought under control and public confidence restored. 7. Gov. Davis did throw a few kind words toward Pres. Bush and Pat Wood saying that each was open to doing more about the high cost of natural gas to California including the possible reimposition of rate regulation of transportation to California. He said he liked Pat Wood and he noted that FERC did not take serious price mitigation action until the two new Bush appointees were on the commission. 8. Lieberman asked the Washington State AG whether the Justice Dept. or the FTC were doing anything to address high energy prices. She said not to her knowledge even though she has asked them to do so. We can expect a Lieberman et al request for Justice and FTC involvement going forward I suspect. 9. While Chairman Lieberman's tone and closing comments were in the nature of his normal thoughtful tone it is clear that he and others see this as a major issue for them to ride. He commended FERC at the end of the hearing for doing their best but pledged he would stay involved closing the session with a smile and the words see you soon.,"Energy; Senate Hearing; FERC; California; Enron; Regulation

718,United India - strictly confidential and privileged,Bruce this memo is dealing with the merits of litigation v arbitration to resolve DPC's DSU claim for the first set of rotor problems. Recall that we tried to negotiate a settlement with insurers for some time and then UI served DPC with a notice of arbitration because of the threat of a bad faith claim. I think I summarized it earlier for you but essentially we now have the choice of pursuing litigation in London against insurers since United India has now sued us in London Court (in addition to arbitration because they figured out a little late that under the policy only quantum may be arbitrated and they don't want to admit liability). Our option before was only to sue them in India which really isn't an option which is why we agreed to arbitration. Basically UI can't decide what it wants to do but this memo from Linklaters sets forth DPC's options which Justin Ken Blades and I discussed regarding the pros and cons of litigation v arbitration. It's a complex mess and I'll be glad to sit down and explain it to you (or not) but we are basically writing to UI's counsel to try and determine what their position is and then we'll decide whether to litigate or arbitrate. Part of this relates to the adjuster's agreement with Ken as to the quantum owed upon a determination of liability. This is all very strange but nothing regarding India or DPC surprises me anymore. We'll talk about it when you have time but I just want you to know I'm taking care of this--let me know how involved you want to be (or not...).

720,RE: Next NERC Reliability Meeting on Legislation -- August 9th,I don't know that NERC has given up on Enron. The timing of next week's meeting to resolve the legislation reflects the legislative realities that the committees of jurisdiction in Congress will take up the realibility legislation along with other electricity issues as early as the second week of September. In fact congressional staff in the Senate and House are drafting legislative language on electricity issues during the August recess. They have pressed the coalition for a final work product. I gathered that at least some of what Jeff'spresentation to the NERC board would be about concerns matters beyond the legislation as such but since they go to the NERC board's operation and independence may go to our comfort level with NERC as the standards setting organization. Given the issues and concerns that have been addressed and communicated to NERC and our preference for the PJM model (as Jeff told John Q. Anderson in the conference call) I think NERC got the information it wanted to get out of the call even though it didn't like the answers: i.e. whether Sarah and I have been faithfully representing Enron's position whether Enron supports an SRO type organization and whether there is anything they can do to get us on board. Perhaps we should have another conference call early next week so that Sarah and I have our guidance from everyone going into the August 9th meeting. For one thing we need to determine if we are in any position to provide detailed comments on the shortened NERC version at the August 9th meeting or whether we do not wish to engage them on what specific changes it would take to get us on board. My sense is that since we have to deal with the players in the room on other issues our overall position will be strengthened if we have some specific comments to make to explain our decision not to support NERC's version even the shortened one. Don't get me wrong -- we have plenty of good reasons not to I just wasn't sure how engaged we wanted to be in identifying changes that would bring us on board since I gather our opposition is more fundamental (no Western deference budget concerns independence issues etc.).

From March 2000 to February 2001 natural gas prices have risen 489 percent compared to a 266 percent increase in New Mexico and a 247 percent jump in Chicago. ??Steinberg asked Ralph Eads the president of an El Paso Natural Gas Co. subsidiary for an explanation. ??The 275 percent difference you say is attributable completely to constraints on the pipeline and demand? Steinberg asked. ??Yes Eads replied. Eads said the state's energy crisis which led power plants to run harder and longer dramatically increased demand for natural gas over the summer and a winter with temperatures about 15 percent cooler than the year before exacerbated the problem. ??In another twist to California's deregulation nightmare El Paso officials said they gained greater control of the pipeline after the Pacific Gas & Electric Co. relinquished the capacity four years ago. At that time PG&E's movement of the gas and the prices it could charge were regulated by the Public Utilities Commission. ??In other developments at the Capitol on Thursday lawmakers called on the federal government to re- regulate natural gas sales at the California border and U.S. Sen. Joe Lieberman D-Conn. said federal regulators should impose price caps on California's wholesale electricity market. ??The Assembly held considerable debate on the resolution asking for re-regulation with Democrats accusing President George W. Bush of doing nothing to come to the aid of California and Republicans defending the administration. ??I'm learning an interesting lesson that all the problems of the world started after Jan. 21 and the inauguration of the new president said Assemblyman Bill Leonard R-San Bernardino. ??KRT CALIFORNIA is a premium service of Knight Ridder/Tribune ??(c) 2001 Contra Costa Times (Walnut Creek Calif.). ??Visit the Contra Costa Times on the Web at http://www.cctimes.com/ JOURNAL-CODE: CC LOAD-DATE: April 20 2001 of 78 DOCUMENTS 2001 / Los Angeles Times Angeles Times ?????????????????????April 20 2001 Friday Home Edition SECTION: Part A Part 1 Page 3 Metro Desk LENGTH: 715 words HEADLINE: CALIFORNIA AND THE WEST A U-TURN ON CAR TAX REBATES LEGISLATION: STARTING JULY 1 FEE REDUCTION WILL BE FIGURED DIRECTLY INTO VEHICLE REGISTRATION BILLS NOT REFUNDED BY MAIL. BYLINE: CARL INGRAM TIMES STAFF WRITER DATELINE: SACRAMENTO BODY: ??Gov. Gray Davis and the Legislature spun a U-turn Thursday and scrapped a costly program that requires motorists to first pay their car tax and then get a rebate in the mail. ??Starting July 1 the state Department of Motor Vehicles will send owners of approximately 26 million vehicles registration renewal bills already reduced by the amount of the vehicle license fee rebates. ??On a unanimous roll call the Senate voted final approval and sent to Davis an urgency bill SB 52 that repealed the rebate program which the governor had previously fought for and defended. ??In addition to abolishing the rebates the legislation reduces by 67.5% the amount motorists must pay for the upcoming year the level that lawmakers and former Gov. Pete Wilson envisioned in 1998 when they began cutting the fee. It had been about 2% of a vehicle's market value. ??Davis immediately signed the repeal bill saying only that the new law will expedite relief to taxpayers and greatly reduce administrative costs. ??The governor's muted observation contrasted with his effusive support of the rebates last year when he said Californians don't appreciate the fact that they're getting a rebate unless they see it in their hands. ??At the time Davis and the Legislature had the choice of simply cutting the car tax which voters might not notice or sending checks in the mail which Davis felt would have a greater impact. ??The rebates which began Jan. 1 were scheduled to continue through 2002 when Davis intends to run for reelection. In 2003 the license fee was to have fallen permanently with no more rebates. ??The whole rebate scheme was good only through the next gubernatorial election cycle said Sen. Tom McClintock (R-Thousand Oaks) who supported reductions in the license fee but opposed the rebates. ??Until July 1 the DMV will continue to bill motorists for the full amount of their license fee which includes a 35% reduction from last year. ??Then we return to you an additional 32.5% rebate making a total reduction of 67.5% said DMV spokesman Bill Branch. Starting with license renewals on July 1 the DMV bills will include the full tax cut. ??A Senate analysis of the repeal bill noted that the current awkward system . . . effectively requires taxpayers to overpay their vehicle license fee and then await a rebate check from the state--a system that is at best difficult to explain. ??But as the California economy tightened the state's budget surplus shrank and taxpayers shelled out approximately $ 50 million a day to buy electricity the costs of the rebate program threatened to become a political embarrassment to Davis. ??Projected administrative and postage costs of the rebate program alone were estimated at $ 22 million this year and another $ 22 million or so next year. ??Last year state Sen. Joe Dunn (D-Santa Ana) and McClintock sought to eliminate the rebates and give drivers their full tax cuts when they register their vehicles. Under pressure from Davis the bill failed. ??It was killed behind the scenes at the insistence of the governor McClintock said Thursday. He didn't want it on his desk. ??This year Dunn launched a similar bill but his name was struck from it as the lead author in the Assembly and the name of Sen. Wes Chesbro (D-Arcata) was substituted. ??In a speech Thursday Sen. Ross Johnson (R-Irvine) suggested that Davis' performance on the issue in an earlier time and a more just society would have resulted in his public flogging by representatives of taxpayers. ??The repeal bill was passed 78 to 0 by the Assembly on Monday and sent to Davis by the Senate on a 34-0 vote Thursday. ??If the rebates were to be abolished the bill had to pass this week in order to take effect July 1 said Branch the DMV spokesman. This is because motorists must be advised 60 days in advance that their registration renewals are due. ??We have to reprogram all the computers. We have to print new bills and mail them by May 1 for the July 1 expiration he said. It will be a little tight but we will still make it. ??Branch said that since the Jan. 1 start of rebates checks totaling $ 454 million have been sent to 7.4 million vehicle owners at an extra administrative cost of $ 9.4 million.

LOPEZ and RICH CONNELL TIMES STAFF WRITERS BODY: ??California Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer ratcheting up his investigation of possible civil and criminal violations by the state's power suppliers is asking a San Francisco judge to order two firms to hand over confidential records. ??In a motion filed Thursday in Superior Court Lockyer said Reliant Energy and Mirant Corp. have failed to comply with subpoenas for documents that were to be produced by March 19. ??Amid soaring electricity costs and rolling blackouts the attorney general launched an investigation of possible manipulation of wholesale electricity prices that have skyrocketed to record levels and have financially crippled the state's major utilities. ??Dozens of other public and private power suppliers are complying with the subpoenas. ??But in an interview Lockyer accused Reliant and Mirant of stonewalling investigators so they can keep enjoying these exorbitant profits and prices for as long as possible. ??Ultimately the companies will have to honor the subpoenas he said. I'm going to pit bull them he said. This is one we win. ??Both companies say they have done nothing wrong and played by the rules of California's flawed electricity deregulation plan. ??A spokesman for Houston-based Reliant said Thursday the firm is seeking court action of its own to ensure that sensitive business information will not be shared with other public agencies or its competitors. ??Last week Reliant asked a Los Angeles Superior Court judge to clarify the attorney general's obligation to keep proprietary information confidential. ??We're glad to cooperate with his investigation to the extent we can said Reliant spokesman Richard Wheatley.  But we have not received sufficient assurances that Lockyer would keep the data confidential. ??Lockyer called Reliant's court filing frivolous and propagandistic and insisted that adequate safeguards are in place. He reserves the right under state law to share information with other government agencies aiding in his investigation but has said he will keep sensitive business information from being made public. ??Atlanta-based Mirant demanded and received similar guarantees of confidentiality Lockyer said. Mirant did not return phones calls Thursday. ??Lockyer did not discuss details of the probe or the kinds of information he's seeking. But based on the investigation so far he said it's beginning to get interesting. ??Other records indicate that the attorney general has sought 91 categories of information about the power merchants' activities. They include the operation of power plants trading information that may have been shared by private power suppliers and bidding strategies in the California market.

S. MUST STEP IN TO PROTECT STATE FROM MANIPULATION BY SUPPLIERS. BYLINE: MITCHELL LANDSBERG and MIGUEL BUSTILLO TIMES STAFF WRITERS BODY: ??This may be the surest sign yet of the depth of California's energy crisis: A bipartisan cross-section of the state's congressional delegation brought together Thursday by Gov. Gray Davis not only agreed about the severity of the problem but also about the need for swift federal intervention. ??This meeting did not have the word 'Democrat' or 'Republican' used once Rep. Darrell E. Issa (R-Vista) said of the unusual spirit of cooperation at the meeting near Los Angeles International airport. ??Members of both parties said the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission must slash wholesale electricity prices so California utilities can once again afford to buy power. Since January the state government has been buying electricity on their behalf as skyrocketing wholesale prices put Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Southern California Edison billions of dollars into debt and many power suppliers refused to sell to them PG&E has since filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. ??Although the Bush administration has said repeatedly that it is strongly opposed to price caps and FERC has refused to grant them California Republicans at the energy meeting said they are optimistic that the administration will agree to some other form of price regulation. They brushed aside the notion that such regulations might conflict with their ideological belief in a free market. ??This is not a free-enterprise situation Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Alpine) said after the meeting. In fact it's just the opposite. ??Specifically citing the huge disparity between natural gas prices charged to California and those charged in other Western states he said California clearly has been the victim of unreasonably high energy costs. Under federal law the FERC must regulate the prices of companies if it finds they are exerting market power to drive prices to unreasonable levels. ??Executives from two Texas energy companies meeting with legislators in Sacramento denied Thursday that they had caused natural gas prices in California to artificially skyrocket by hoarding access to a critical pipeline into the state. ??After the extraordinary meeting in Los Los Angeles Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) said the biggest disagreement between California Democrats and Republicans appeared to be their relative faith--or lack thereof--in the ability of President Bush and his administration to help California. There has been much speculation that Bush who lost California in November has no political motive to help the state. ??We Democrats said Sherman hope very much that our skepticism is proven wrong. ??Davis--who sat flanked by Democratic U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein and the governor's newly appointed chief energy advisor S. David Freeman--said he used the meeting mainly to discuss the importance of conservation by Californians this summer and to ask the congressional delegation to pitch in. Five Republicans and more than a dozen Democrats attended the gathering. ??Feinstein said Thursday that she has asked for a third time to meet with Bush to discuss the energy situation. Meeting with Times reporters and editors Wednesday she described a recent meeting with Vice President Dick Cheney in which she said he ignored her appeal for federal assistance. ??Feinstein has been among those critical of natural gas companies saying they appear to have constricted access to a California-bound pipeline to run up prices. ??The Brattle Group a respected consulting firm alleged Wednesday before an Assembly committee that Dynegy Inc. and El Paso Natural Gas Co. had manipulated the market by charging so much for the rights to their pipeline capacity that they had in effect withheld access to it. ??That action the experts said directly forced companies trying to deliver gas to California to look for alternatives clogging other pipelines and causing a surge in prices. ??The explanation El Paso executives said was simple: Demand for gas soared in California because generators that use gas to make electricity increased production last year in response to the energy crisis. ??We're not withholding capacity--no one is said El Paso Merchant Energy President Ralph Eads. With these prices you want to sell every molecule. ??In other developments Thursday: ??* The agreement between Davis and Edison International to return its ailing utility arm to financial health is in deep trouble and could be rejected by legislators the Standard & Poor's credit rating agency said in a note to clients citing legislative and other sources. A rejection of the deal would be a humiliating setback for the governor S&P said. ??The agreement calls for among other things the sale of Edison's transmission grid to the state for $ 2.76 billion and the sale of $ 2 billion in bonds--both designed to pay off the utility's huge electricity debt. Edison agreed to several constraints including the sale of electricity to the state at prices tied to the cost of producing power. ??Since they returned Monday from a two-week recess state legislators have been sharply critical of the Edison agreement and have indicated a desire to tinker with aspects of the deal. Some lawmakers have said publicly that a bankruptcy protection filing by Edison like that of PG&E might not be such a dire outcome. ??But a senior Edison executive said it is way too early to give up on passage of the proposal which legislators have not yet seen in official form. ??There is an education process to do here the executive said of the highly detailed 38-page document. The legislators should be asking questions. That is appropriate. ??* The Public Utilities Commission voted to investigate whether alternative energy providers violated contractual agreements by withholding supplies from PG&E and Edison which owe them hundreds of millions of dollars. ??The action Commissioner Carl W. Wood said was prompted in part by lawsuits some providers have filed seeking release from their contracts with the cash-starved utilities. The producers of solar wind and geothermal energy account for more than 25% of California's electricity supply. ??The question is whether we will be able to rely on them in the long hot days of summer Wood said. ??Jack Raudy of the Renewable Energy Creditors Committee said the PUC needs to address the $ 700 million the producers are owed. All we have gotten is rhetoric from the governor the PUC and the utilities he said. ??* An $ 850-million plan to entice Californians to conserve precious megawatts appears to be running into roadblocks compounding predictions by state officials of tighter than expected energy supplies in May and June. ??Davis signed the conservation spending package last week earmarking $ 242 million of the new funds for the Public Utilities Commission to distribute to the state's investor-owned utilities to support existing conservation programs. ??But Barbara Hale director of the PUC's Division of Strategic Planning said Thursday that since Pacific Gas & Electric Co. filed for bankruptcy protection April 6 the utility has stopped releasing conservation funds. ??Hale testifying before a state Senate committee said PG&E's decision--coupled with the threat that Southern California Edison could follow a similar route to U.S. Bankruptcy Court--has complicated her agency's efforts. ??PG&E spokeswoman Staci Homrig said her company plans to petition the Bankruptcy Court to have the conservation funds designated as a trust and separated from assets tied up in the bankruptcy proceedings. She said if the court denies the request PG&E would ask to be permitted to pay the expenses anyway. The process she added could take about a month--too long in the view of some legislators given increasingly gloomy energy forecasts for late spring and early summer. ??Deputy Director Bob Therkelsen of the California Energy Commission said his agency had been counting on a number of small power producers to bolster their output during that period. But he said some producers did not purchase the necessary equipment because PG&E and Edison have failed to pay them in full for earlier electricity deliveries. ??It's not a huge amount he said of the anticipated production shortfall but every little bit helps. ??* ??Landsberg reported from Los Angeles Bustillo from Sacramento.

There is some willingness they say to consider some price controls even though the Bush administration is adamantly opposed to such measures. ??Many are looking to see if President Bush's choices for the two vacancies on FERC will provide a margin for change. ??But the commission's basic philosophy that open unregulated markets are best is not likely to change soon members say. ??I've been championing a revamping of FERC's antiquated standards for determining market-based rates Commissioner Richard Massey said Thursday. But with no success.  My agency is not on the verge of turning on a dime on this market-based pricing. ??The standards are a joke Massey added because the commission never turns down requests for such pricing authority. More than 600 power sellers have been given that authority he said. ??For a power company to be allowed to charge whatever the market will bear it must show FERC for example that it doesn't have the power to manipulate the market and drive prices up. ??Any seller that can't pass our screen needs to fire their consultants and lawyers Massey said. ??While the overall philosophy remains consistent FERC staff has proposed to the commission that a Stage 3 electricity emergency in California should trigger cost-based rates a form of price controls. Such triggers would be in place for one year under the staff proposal. ??The commission may decide Wednesday whether to accept that proposal. It has to make some decision by May 1 on how the market will be monitored from now on. ??The theory behind controlling prices in Stage 3 says a FERC staff report is that during such an emergency generators have the greatest opportunity to manipulate the market and drive prices up. ??But generators have that power during Stage 2 and Stage 1 emergencies says Les Starck Southern California Edison Co.'s manager of federal regulatory affairs. Price caps during Stage 3 might avert the rolling blackouts associated with that level of crisis but they wouldn't do anything to stop generators from jacking up prices the rest of the time he said. ??It is not clear how long it would take for such price controls to take effect should the commission go along with the staff recommendation. ??We're close because summer is approaching Commissioner Linda Breathitt said Thursday. Breathitt who had firmly opposed any form of price controls said in an interview last month that given the worsening crisis in California she was open to considering some short-term measures. ??It's important to me that we address the summer Breathitt said but said she wasn't able to predict what the commission would do Wednesday. ??Even if an order is approved Massey said there could be delays while the power sellers file their costs with regulators and disputes over those filings are handled. ??Sen. Dianne Feinstein said Thursday such a move by the commission would be better than having no controls at all. There's no question that we're going to be in a Stage 3 emergency. ??Feinstein D-Calif. and other Western lawmakers have been urging FERC to step in sooner and with price controls that extend beyond just the emergency period. ??Waiting for Stage 3 to intervene is putting the whole grid at risk said Roger Hamilton a member of Oregon's Public Utility Commission. We have a real stability problem when you cut it that close. ??Feinstein says the future could well rest with the new commissioners particularly Patrick Wood the head of the Texas PUC who many believe will replace Curt Heber as FERC chairman if he is confirmed by the Senate. ??Even if Massey and Breathitt agree on broader price controls as chairman Heber could block consideration of such a move. It's unclear what stance Wood would take as chairman. ??The thing that deeply concerns me about Pat Wood is that he's from Texas Feinstein said. What's reassuring is that it appears from my personal discussion with him is that he appears to be pragmatic. ??But once again timing could be a problem. ??Bush has said he intends to nominate Wood and Nora Brownell a member of the Pennsylvania PUC but has not formally sent their nominations to the Senate. ??The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is of vital importance right now and to let the time go on without filling the spots makes no sense Feinstein said. Please please please President Bush process your nominees. ??KRT CALIFORNIA is a premium service of Knight Ridder/Tribune ??(c) 2001 The Orange County Register (Santa Ana Calif.). ??Visit the Register on the World Wide Web at http://www.ocregister.com/ JOURNAL-CODE: OC LOAD-DATE: April 20 2001 of 78 DOCUMENTS ??????????????Copyright 2001 Knight Ridder/Tribune News Service ???????????????????????Knight Ridder/Tribune News Service Jose Mercury News 20 2001 Friday SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS KR-ACC-NO: ?K512 LENGTH: 696 words HEADLINE: In response to power woes rating agencies have California on credit watch BYLINE: By Jennifer Bjorhus BODY: ??SAN JOSE Calif. _ All three of the nation's influential judges of credit risk now have California on credit watch saying they are deeply concerned about the economic impact of the state's power crisis. ??The Fitch credit rating agency made it unanimous Wednesday when it warned that the thickening electricity quagmire as well as lower than expected tax revenues in February and March could spell broader risk for the state's budget. ??The announcement is a signal that Fitch too may downgrade its ratings on California's nearly $30 billion in public debt a move which could cost taxpayers millions. ??The announcement comes as state lawmakers mull a bailout plan for Southern California Edison Pacific Gas & Electric Co. sits in bankruptcy and state officials bleed through the state's general fund as they purchase expensive electricity for consumers. Earlier this week Gov. Gray Davis announced that the average daily bill for electricity purchases has risen from $45.8 million a day in the last week of March to $73 million a day. ??Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's have already issued their own credit warnings although none of the three agencies has actually downgraded the state's very good double-A credit rating. ??Bond ratings are important yardsticks that bankers and investors use to price municipal and corporate bonds. A downgrade would force California to offer bondbuyers higher interest rates going forward costing taxpayers. ??The state was last at a lower A rating back in 1994. ??Moody's changed California's Aa2 general obligation bond rating outlook from stable to negative on April 6 the day Pacific Gas & Electric Co. filed for bankruptcy. Standard & Poor's has had the state's AA rating outlook at negative since January when the state began buying electricity for the utilities. ??The deciding factor for Fitch said Fitch vice chairman Claire Cohen was the disagreement over how the money from the new electricity rate hike will be spent. ??The California Public Utilities Commission ruled in late March that money generated by higher electricity bills should go first to pay the state Department of Water Resources which has been buying electricity for the utilities. Pacific Gas & Electric Co. has argued that if the state is paid first there won't be any money left for it. ??The utility is formally challenging the PUC decision and the move threatens to hold up the estimated $12 billion to $14 billion of bonds the Department of Water Resources plans to issue to buy more electricity. ??With that being appealed you don't have a clean authorization Cohen said. It signals to me that it could delay the financing process. ??A second concern is that the state isn't collecting as much in taxes as expected Cohen said. Tax collections for both February and March were below forecast. The amount of personal income tax the state collected in those months fell short by $455 million or 14% less than expected. ??Cohen said she made her decision before hearing that the state's power costs now exceed $70 million a day. Cohen and David Hitchcock the California analyst for Standard & Poors agreed those rising costs are a definite concern. ??It doesn't take much of a change in economic growth to make some of these projected fund balances disappear and so we're very worried about what the current economic activity is particularly in Northern California with some of the problems with the high tech area Hitchcock told analysts and investors last week in a conference call. ??State treasurer Phillip Angelides was traveling Thursday and couldn't be reached for comment. Other economy-watchers expressed concern. ??Sandy Harrison assistant director of the state Dept. of Finance said the move reinforced the importance of solving the current power problems soon. ??It's important to note that the rating hasn't been lowered yet and does remain very strong he said. ??KRT CALIFORNIA is a premium service of Knight Ridder/Tribune ??(c) 2001 San Jose Mercury News (San Jose Calif.). ??Visit Mercury Center the World Wide Web site of the Mercury News at http://www.sjmercury.com/ JOURNAL-CODE: SJ LOAD-DATE: April 20 2001 of 78 DOCUMENTS ??????????????Copyright 2001 Knight Ridder/Tribune News Service ???????????????????????Knight Ridder/Tribune News Service Jose Mercury News 20 2001 Friday SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS KR-ACC-NO: ?K520 LENGTH: 1069 words HEADLINE: Issues still remain on what power consumers will eventually pay BYLINE: By John Woolfolk and Michael Bazeley BODY: ??SAN JOSE Calif. _ State regulators last month announced an electric rate increase that would average a whopping three cents per kilowatt hour hit bills beginning in May and punish power pigs while sparing energy misers. ??Now much of that is up in the air. ??Higher rates are surely coming _ but not before June. Exactly which consumers and businesses will pay how much is uncertain as regulators rush to forge a rate structure from a tangle of more than 20 proposals. ??Their task has been complicated immeasurably by Gov. Gray Davis' decision to weigh in with a competing rate plan and Pacific Gas & Electric's move into bankruptcy court. ??Little details are moving billions of dollars around said Nettie Hoge of consumer advocate group TURN. ??All the proposals assume a tiered structure that forces the heaviest users of energy to pay the most. But key details yet to be decided mean consumers could see their average rates go up anywhere from 7 percent to 30 percent or more. ??Among them: ??_How much of an overall increase? The Public Utilities Commission approved a 3-cent per kilowatt hour increase last month which would boost utility revenue $4.8 million. Gov. Gray Davis' hike _ left vague in Davis' April 5 television address _ averages 2.8 cents for PG&E customers but only 2.3 cents for customers of Southern California Edison. ??_What regions of the state will pay? The commission agreed to raise rates only for Pacific Gas & Electric and Southern California Edison but Davis would include the additional 1.2 million San Diego Gas & Electric customers. ??_Should heavier users of electricity subsidize those who are exempt from the new rate increase? If so those users will find themselves paying much more than any of the average increase figures being tossed about. ??_How will utilities bill customers retroactively for the increase? At the time of the PUC vote on March 27 commissioner said their increase would take effect immediately. ??Various plans are being presented this week to an administrative law judge working for the commission. The judge is expected to recommend a rate structure to the PUC on May 4. Public hearings would follow May 7-11 and the commission would vote on a plan May 14 condensing to a few weeks a process that normally lasts nearly a year. ??Each of the major proposals before the commission assumes that residential customers using less than 130 percent of their baseline would be exempt from higher rates. That's mandated under a new law that allows the state to buy power. Customers already pay higher rates for exceeding their baseline which is the average basic level of use for each region of the state. ??Each major proposal also sets new tiers with progressively higher rates for medium use at 130 to 200 percent of baseline and heavy use over 200 percent of that level. ??But that's where the similarities end. ??The first distinction among the leading plans comes in the form of an assumption: How many residential customers will avoid any increase because they don't exceed 130 percent of their baseline? Davis says more than half commissioners say a little under half and PG&E says less than a third. ??The second difference among the plans is a real difference: What happens to everyone else? ??Under the plan by utilities commission President Loretta Lynch medium PG&E users would see average bills rise 9 percent and heavy users would see bills increase 36 percent. ??Davis' plan says medium PG&E users would see average bills rise 11 percent while heavy users would pay 37 percent more. But the average total bill increase for PG&E residential customers including those who are exempt would be 20 percent under his plan and 24 percent under Lynch's according to a statement on the governor's web site. ??Business customers would see proportionately greater increases averaging 30 percent under Lynch's proposal and 26 percent under Davis'. ??The most consumer-friendly of the various proposals comes from consumer-rights group TURN. They suggest an overall average residential increase of just 7.5 percent. ??TURN's plan assumes utilities cannot charge other customers more to make up for the energy misers shielded from rate increases under state law. ??PG&E disagrees with that interpretation. The utility wants other residential users to make up for any lost revenue from exempted customers through higher rates. Under the utility's plan residential customers would see an average rate hike of nearly 30 percent. ??The proposal these folks are pushing rips the heart out of that law said Matthew Freedman staff attorney for TURN. ??Another issue affecting consumers is how the utilities can bill for electricity used in April and May before the final plan is approved. ??Utility officials have objected to making the rate structure retroactive. Instead to recoup the revenue they are proposing a flat surcharge that everyone would pay regardless of how much they use. ??Edison proposes a higher surcharge added to bills for a shorter period of time _ in this case June through August. PG&E officials are suggesting a smaller surcharge that would be spread out over 12 months. ??It'll probably be something closer to the PG&E proposal Paul Clanon the commission's director of energy issues. ??All the rate increase proposals stem from a commonly understood problem: California's current frozen rates don't generate enough money to cover the wholesale price of power. The PUC raised rates 10 percent _ or 1 cent per kilowatt hour _ in January in an attempt to help but that turned out to be far from enough. ??In March the Commission approved an additional 3-cent increase. But Davis followed quickly with an alternative proposal. The next day PG&E filed for bankruptcy raising the specter that a federal judge could order even higher rates. ??Although the PUC has sole authority to raise rates under state law Davis' proposal has complicated an already complex process. The governor appointed three of the five members of the commission and his appointees seem inclined to show him deference. But Davis has been slow in filing the details of his plan which has made it hard for the PUC to proceed. ??KRT CALIFORNIA is a premium service of Knight Ridder/Tribune ??(c) 2001 San Jose Mercury News (San Jose Calif.). ??Visit Mercury Center the World Wide Web site of the Mercury News at http://www.sjmercury.com/ JOURNAL-CODE: SJ LOAD-DATE: April 20 2001 of 78 DOCUMENTS ?????????????????Copyright 2001 The Chronicle Publishing Co. ?????????????????????????The San Francisco Chronicle ????????????????????APRIL 20 2001 FRIDAY FINAL EDITION SECTION: NEWS Pg. A4 LENGTH: 765 words HEADLINE: Edison pushes lawmakers to accept deal SOURCE: Chronicle Staff Writer BYLINE: David Lazarus BODY: Although lawmakers are skeptical of the state's multibillion-dollar deal to acquire the power lines of Southern California Edison the head of the utility's parent company warned yesterday that failure to approve the accord could lead to a long and costly bankruptcy. ???But John Bryson chief executive of Edison International told The Chronicle that he thought legislators would want to do the right thing by approving the multibillion-dollar agreement and preventing Edison from following Pacific Gas and Electric Co. into bankruptcy court. ???Bankruptcy for California's two largest utilities could have severe consequences for consumers. Financial analysts said a worsening of the state's energy mess would increase the possibility of higher electricity rates. ???Nevertheless lawmakers are unlikely to accept the Edison deal -- at least not in its present form. ???We are going to go through this thing extensively said state Senate President Pro Tem John Burton D-San Francisco. There are a lot of concerns about the valuation. ???Still he said legislative backing for the accord remains possible as long as Edison is open to amending some of the terms. ???The Edison people are smart enough to know that the Legislature is going to have its say Burton said. ???Indeed sources familiar with the matter said Edison expected a certain amount of tinkering with the deal and would not resist efforts to reach common ground with lawmakers. ???The Assembly members do not view bankruptcy as a favorable alternative said Assemblyman Herb Wesson D-Los Angeles. There will be a big effort to try and work something out. ???Edison's Bryson seems eager at this point to present himself and his company as reasonable business partners who are willing to negotiate in good faith. ???This contrasts sharply with the state's relations with PG&E which turned acrimonious after PG&E blindsided the governor with its bankruptcy filing. Each side blamed the other for the collapse of earlier negotiations. ???We made the decision at an early stage that this was a massive problem for the state and that the best course was to find a practical solution that would allow us to get on with operating our power system Bryson said. ???Bankruptcy he said is absolutely a last resort. It's a long and costly process. ???It is also the last thing Wall Street wants to see. On Wednesday rating agency Fitch Inc. joined Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investor Service in warning that California's credit rating could be lowered because of the state's energy mess. ???The state may be forced to issue junk bonds said Carol Coale an energy-industry analyst at Prudential Securities in New York. This could lead to a surcharge on electricity bills to guarantee the bonds. ???Bryson not surprisingly defended Edison's agreement with the governor as a prudent alternative to bankruptcy. ???This is a very good deal for the state he said. It is not a bailout. Edison gives up a lot to make all this possible. ???Southern California Edison will sell its power lines to the state for $2.8 billion. It also will provide low-cost power to California for 10 years and drop a federal lawsuit seeking full recovery of nearly $5 billion in past debt. ???Critics say the state is paying far too much for Edison's transmission system -- more than two times book value -- and that the power lines are of little use unless PG&E's grid also can be acquired. ???It's a multibillion-dollar ratepayer bailout of Edison said Doug Heller a spokesman for the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in Santa Monica. Edison gets off scot-free. ???Under the most likely scenario lawmakers will seek to reduce the amount paid for Edison's power lines and to increase the role of the California Public Utilities Commission in regulating the utility. ???They also will try to come up with a workable contingency plan for the state if PG&E remains adamant in its refusal to sell off its part of the power grid. ???The deal on the table is still salvageable said Michael Shames executive director of the Utility Consumers' Action Network in San Diego. But Edison needs to understand that what it got from the governor is only a framework not set in stone. ???For his part Bryson signaled that plenty of room existed for give and take on the issue. ???We're just at the initial stage he said. We always have accepted the notion that Edison is a California regulated utility and is subject to the laws of the Public Utilities Commission.E-mail David Lazarus at dlazarus@sfchronicle.com.

PG&E saying it hasn't received the help it needs from regulators or state lawmakers filed for federal bankruptcy protection April 6. ??Edison is continuing to work with state officials and its creditors. ??The utility said its board of directors decided to withhold bonuses to all but two key executives because the financial effects of the energy crisis have overshadowed all other aspects of company and individual performance. ??The two executives who did get bonuses earned them for their roles in preserving the viability of the companies during the crisis and for retention purposes Edison said. ??Ted Craver senior vice president chief financial officer and treasurer at Edison International was paid $375000 in 2000 and received a $100000 bonus.

The previous administration felt compelled to dominate the evening news every day and the president said 'I'm focused on getting the job done' Rove said Wednesday in an Associated Press interview. ??Running a low-key presidency sets Bush apart from former President Clinton but the style has its critics. ??Some lawmakers including members of his own party said Bush could have saved more of his $1.6 trillion tax-cut plan if he had personally lobbied more lawmakers. ??Bush issued a statement expressing sympathy with police and protesters in Cincinnati but ran the risk of looking detached. ??And Rove acknowledged that there was some discussion in the White House about Bush attending the U.S. crew's homecoming to reap the public relations reward for freeing the crew. ??But the president vetoed the idea according to Rove who quoted Bush as saying I want it to be about them and I don't want to go through the discombobulation that it would require of them and their families for me to show up. ??It is not hard to imagine Clinton commanding center stage during city riots a budget battle or an international crisis but Rove said We intended to have a smaller profile than the previous administration. ??Bush's attitude is that he's not going to be measured by whether or not he gets on the evening news but on whether or not he gets progress Rove said during the 45-minute interview. ??He sat at a polished wood conference table in his West Wing office his hands folded over a memo he had discretely turned upside down. Newspapers and a Starbucks coffee mug littered his desktop. Framed photos and artwork were propped against a chair still awaiting hanging on his 89th day in the White House. ??A painting of a Texas landscape decorated one wall allowing Bush's political strategist of eight years to go on vacation whenever I'm on the phone. ??Rove is on the telephone a lot these days crafting strategies to pass the White House legislative agenda maintain GOP control of Congress in 2002 and position the president for a re-election bid in 2004. ??Bush narrowly won the White House without California's 54 electoral votes and Rove said the president could win re-election without the state but it's always nicer to carry the Golden State. ??He said the state's electricity shortage will not hurt Bush's chances in 2004 adding that the administration has done virtually everything Gov. Gray Davis has requested. ??He suggested that the state caused its own problems by not building enough power plants and failing to follow the lead of other states such as Bush's Texas to establish sound energy policies before a crisis struck. ??This has got a very human dimension to it Rove said. It's one thing to talk about power supplies. It's another thing when you talk about how it affects their jobs how it's affecting their livelihoods how it's affecting the safety of their communities and the health of their families. This is a tough issue and it ought to be a wake up call for the entire country. ??A White House task force headed by Vice President Dick Cheney is working on recommendations to address both short-term problems of soaring electricity and natural gas prices and longer-term energy supply problems focusing on producing more domestic oil and gas and building more electric power plants. ??Rove said the administration will soon unveil new conservation measures aimed at helping California ease its shortages. ??He said Bush and his political team are bringing House Republicans from politically competitive states to the White House where they discuss their districts' needs and often gain local media attention. ??Bush also plans to attend fund-raisers for House and Senate campaign committees helping the party gear up for 2002 midterm elections in which control of Congress is at stake. ??Rove also said: ??-Bush will not seek broad authority to negotiate trade treaties anytime soon allowing time to make the legislation more attractive to Democrats. You can only put so much into that pipe and we've stuffed it he said of Bush's crowded legislative agenda. The fast track authority is key to Bush's plans for a free trade zone stretching from Canada to Chile. That proposal is the focus of the three-day Summit of the Americas beginning Friday in Quebec City. ??-Americans will support Bush's environmental policies despite criticism of his decision to overturn some initiatives of the final days of the Clinton administration. Rove stopped short of accusing Clinton of setting Bush up for political troubles. I'm not certain I see a conspiracy there. I do think it's interesting that Clinton waited until the last moment to act. ??-Bush has not wavered since the campaign in his view that states should be able to opt out of minimum wage increases passed by Congress. We are not all one single labor market Rove said.

The regulatory staff recommends a $108.7 million increase. For residential customers a requested 34-percent hike would be reduced to 16 percent. ??This is not a final decision said Jeff Beaman a spokesman for IDACORP and Idaho Power. In many cases the commissioners disagree with the staff. ??The report noted there was nothing illegal about the transactions between Idaho Power and its sister company Idaho Energy Systems. To change that the staff urged commissioners to create a mechanism that forces Idaho Power to buy electricity at the same price Idaho Energy Systems pays for it. ??The report said Idaho Energy Systems an unregulated subsidiary of IDACORP repeatedly purchased electricity on the wholesale market and then sold it to Idaho Power for a profit. ??Idaho Power officials contend the recommended policy change could financially cripple the company. It already spent $161 million buying power on the open market and cannot recover the money unless the coming year's rate is increased. ??The failure to recoup these funds could lead to liquidity problems Beaman said and that will hurt not only the company but our customers as well. ??But IDACORP paid all of its salaried staff - including Idaho Power employees - a 15-percent bonus at the end of the last fiscal year because the company had achieved record profits of $139.9 million 53 percent over the year before. ??Beaman said incentive payments have no impact on the rate request. ??Charging the higher rate between the two subsidiaries was the result of a commission order tying the price that Idaho Energy charges for wholesale electricity to the Mid-Columbia Index. The index has been pegged at unrealistic levels since the energy crisis erupted in California and fluctuates constantly. ??We are confident that the transactions were performed within the letter and spirit of the law and have not been at the expense of ratepayers Beaman said. ??Commission spokesman Gene Fadness said commissioners cannot comment on a case before them but their ultimate decision can be appealed to the Idaho Supreme Court. ??The Public Utilities Commission staff also recommended: ??- Deferring $66.1 million of Idaho Power's rate request without interest until answers are available about the company's electricity deals. ??- Deferring another $45.8 million of the request until next year when the commissioners would allow Idaho Power to collect 5-percent interest. That part of the hike was earmarked for wholesale power purchases this year - purchases that the staff believes will be much more expensive next year. ??- Cutting another $10.3 million from the increase request contending it was an error by Idaho Power's Risk Management Committee that the company planned on passing on to ratepayers. ??- Implementing a low-interest loan program to encourage energy conservation by Idaho Power customers. ??- A two-year phase-in of any rate increase ultimately approved that is substantially over 20 percent. ??- Changing residential rates to a three-tiered system to encourage savings. ??Homeowners would pay 5.52 cents per kilowatt-hour for the first 800 kwh used 6.12 cents per kwh for use between 800 kwh and 2000 kwh and 7.48 cents per kwh for use over 2000 kwh. The current residential rate of 5.2 cents per kwh. ??The staff report also took Idaho Power to task saying it was warned of the possibility of spiraling prices and power shortages as far back as 1995. ??But the company contends it did not want to build generating plants during the past decade because with electricity deregulation looming nobody knew what independent power facilities were being considered.

It's obviously way higher than $100 million. ??Natural gas rates at the California border generally tracked national prices until November when they spiked as high as 11 times higher than the price of natural gas elsewhere in the nation Carpenter said. ??I have never seen gas prices like this anywhere in the world said Carpenter who has been studying the energy market for 20 years for Cambridge Mass.-based consultant The Brattle Group. The Brattle Group was hired by Edison to study the natural gas market. ??The committee is one of two legislative committees exploring whether illegal market manipulation in the electricity and natural gas markets has driven up California's energy costs. ??This is a market that is plagued by the exercise of market power Frank Wolak chairman of the California Independent System Operator's Market Surveillance Committee told the Senate Select Committee to Investigate Price Manipulation of the Wholesale Energy Market. The ISO runs the state's power grid. ??However there is no law against me saying 'I'm not going to sell to you' Wolak said. Market manipulation only becomes illegal when there is collusion Wolak said and such evidence is hard to find. ??Electricity generators and natural gas suppliers say a severe supply and demand imbalance - not market manipulation - has led to higher prices. ??Everybody's busy doing investigations. They're not interested in solving the problem said Independent Energy Producers Executive Director Jan Smutny-Jones. ??Investigations are wasting everybody's time Smutny-Jones said adding that previous probes and lawsuits have uncovered no wrongdoing. He said the state's power problems came because state regulators denied utilities the chance to sign long-term energy contracts when they had the chance. ??People have been playing by the rules Smutny-Jones said. ??But the Senate committee's first witnesses are ISO officials who authored studies that claim the state paid more than $6 billion too much for power last year. ??Committee chair Joseph Dunn D-Garden Grove also has slated state Auditor Elaine Howell who last month blamed buyers and sellers for skyrocketing electricity costs. Dunn also has scheduled future testimony from state federal academic and private investigators studying the power market. ??He invited five major generators to attend the committee's second hearing next week. All five - Reliant Dynegy Williams Energy Duke Energy and Mirant - say they are eager to cooperate and clear their names Dunn said. ??Dunn asked the five for a total of 86 specific documents. If the companies feel they cannot provide documents because of legal or confidentiality concerns Dunn said he will subpoena them. ??Smutny-Jones said investigators appear to be growing desperate to blame the state's natural gas and electricity price hikes on illegal market manipulation instead of natural market forces. ??He cited Attorney General Bill Lockyer's announcement last week that any informant who helped prove wrongdoing would be entitled to a percentage of the state's recovery he estimated could range from $50 million to hundreds of millions of dollars. ??If the state's offering a $50 million reward they haven't found anything Smutny-Jones said. I don't think you're going to find the fact that anybody did anything criminal here. ??Assemblywoman Jenny Oropeza D-Long Beach said she believes otherwise after Wednesday's testimony: I think it is very clear there was some price manipulation going on. ??But Assemblyman John Campbell R-Irvine isn't sure there was anything illegal. ??There clearly are market forces at work that's evident Campbell said. Whether you make the jump to market manipulation ... I haven't seen conclusive evidence that leads me to make that jump. LOAD-DATE: April 20 2001,"Energy; California; Politics

First I apologize for my prolonged recent absences. I have had two long-standing academic projects: one was due 4/19 (it was on final review - a paper about corporate political strategy - and just was accepted for publication at our top academic journal) and another is due 5/31. The 5/31 paper was commissioned long ago but is a key paper in a June conference (topic is methods to study corporate political activities and the public affairs function). In order to get it done properly I need to forego any work at Enron until later in the month. A project of interest to me at Enron - and I hope one that you also have interest - is assessing the effectiveness of governmental affairs. John told me that he conducted such a study for the group last year. One of the methodological challenges is to calculate the benefits that government affairs brings - especially in a system where for example on the legislative side much of the work of government affairs is to block legislation at very early stages. I suspect that govt. affairs needs to justify its existence for internal budgets at Enron and thus the benefits of the function are important to quantify. I'd like to review any of the previous work and make suggestions as necessary. At some point let me know how you would like to proceed. Otherwise I hope all is well with you all.

While there is always some value in these things it is ususally quite small and consumes more valuable resources in trying to capture the benefit than the benefit itself. From: Michael B Rosen@ECT on 07/13/2001 08:44 AM To: Steven J Kean/NA/Enron@Enron cc: Subject: A&M - Bush Library Foundation & School of Public Policy Steve- We have been approached by the Texas A&M/George Bush Presidential Library Foundation and School of Public Policy to endow additional funds. Enron had made an original contribution to the library foundation back in 1998 totaling $250K over five years. I am working with Community Relations and A/A Recruiting to evaluate the latest request and to discuss where Enron may have interest or find leverage for our Government Affairs Recruiting or PR efforts. The Foundation is willing to work with us to establish whatever type of program(s) and/or participatory involvement we would like. We have discussed an Enron speaker series classroom lectures advisory committee seats and the likes. I have already had a chance to run this by Rick Shapiro and Rob Bradley. Although Rick was noncommittal regarding his team's time for speaking or lecturing he seemed supportive of the effort. Rob has already been participating in some speaking opportunities there and supported expanded efforts. What are your thoughts on contribution levels (another $250K was suggested by CR) and any specific program or relationship opportunities regarding the Library Center or School of Public Policy. Please grab me for quick conversation when you have time. Thanks. Mike,"Education; Philanthropy; Texas A&M University; Government Affairs

755,Re: Draft New Power press release,In the second paragraph we should delete the partnership statement. I think it's more effective to refer to the New Power Company's risk management capabilities (as provided by Enron if necessary). That's the basis for the ability to guarantee savings (not economies of scale). I am also concerned that the current statement implies that Enron is taking the risk on the commodity price guarantees.

761,Call to Bob Glynn,Per our discussion this morning below is a summary of items to discuss with Glynn: Adding Enron's negative CTC claim to the list of claims: PGE's filing included a list of top twenty creditors. Our negative CTC claim was apparently not taken into account in compiling that list. The list is nonbinding however. PG&E will be required to file schedules of creditors on April 20. Our negative CTC claim should be on Schedule F (for unsecured claims). You may want to remind Glynn of your previous conversations and state our expectation that the negative CTC claim will appear (preferably as uncontested) in the April 20 filing. (Note: if PG&E does not include the claim we have an opportunity to file a proof of claim and ultimately the court determines the validity of the claim). Including Enron on the Creditors' Committee: PG&E may have the opportunity to influence representation on the creditors' committees. There are several reasons to suggest to Glynn that we be included: 1) we are a big creditor 2) we could be helpful in crafting a broader solution and 3) we are one of the real parties in interest behind the PX and ISO (who were listed as significant creditors but are really just passthroughs for the suppliers ... and PG&E likely would not want to have those political bodies serving on the creditors committee anyway).,"Bankruptcy; PG&E; Enron

778,Confidential -Strategic Question,Today's strong gas prices have opened a new window of opportunity for a pipeline to move Wyoming gas into the Ventura market and downstream. Currently Trailblazer is conducting an open season to expand its facilities for service between Wyoming and Gage County Nebraska. A number of our contacts in the Powder River (including ENA) are making decisions on Trailblazer capacity right now. When we invested in the Bighorn gas gathering project in December of 1999 we viewed a connection between Bighorn and Northern Border Pipeline (250miles) as a strategic advantage to be exploited in the future. Strong gas prices and the ramp of Powder River production are accelerating the feasibility of making a pipeline out of the Northern Powder River Basin a reality. While connecting the Powder River Basin to NBPL using an intrastate pipeline through Montana remains a real possibility it also carries with it the negative baggage of NBPL being fully contracted through 2003 (and possibly beyond) with Canadian gas and a potential for Alaskan gas. In the short term this presents us with some problems getting shippers to sign up for transport on the new Montana intrastate. I would like you to think about the following concept . A new interstate pipeline named NBP-Dakota extending from the Recluse Wyoming area to Ventura Iowa and going into service in November of 2003. A tentative design and cost would be 24 diameter 1435 MAOP 480 miles with capex of approximately $270 million. Initial flow would be 300 mmcfd with expansion capability up to 490 mmcfd and an initial rate of just under 50 cents per mcf Recluse to Ventura. At today's Ventura price of $4.22 this could leave Powder River producers a margin of more than $2.00 an mcf. Using August 1999 Ventura pricing of $2.64 the margin would be 64 cents. If we can build the pipeline at the cost projected (NPNG has used Fort Union's actual construction costs for a 24 inch 1440psi system - Enron Engineering would not even be in the same cost universe) NBP Dakota would be more competitive than sending the gas to NBPL via the Montana intrastate. I am of the opinion that future looping the Trailblazer system would come in as 3rd place to the other 2 routes. NBP Dakota would need to get started with an open season this fall to allow for a 2003 in-service date. THE QUESTION I need your opinion about using NBP Dakota for this opportunity rather than feeding more gas into NBPL in the northern Montana area. Strategically are we willing to let NBPL carry the possible risk of decontracting after 2003 without support from the Powder River Basin ? For what it may be worth I believe NBPL can handle that risk successfully without the Powder River volumes. I need to know your views on this as the Montana intrastate topic is coming up for discussion at the Bighorn Management Committee meeting later this summer.,"Energy; Pipelines; Business Strategy

Suppliers deny the= =20 accusation.=20 By TIM REITERMAN and NANCY RIVERA BROOKS Times Staff Writers=20 ?????Wholesale electricity suppliers overcharged California by about $5.5= =20 billion between May and last month and that money should be refunded to th= e=20 state's taxpayers and financially strapped utilities the state power grid= =20 operator said Wednesday. ?????Generators engaged in market manipulation and consistent patterns of= =20 bidding far above costs in the deregulated energy market the California=20 Independent System Operator found in a study of pricing data. The findings= =20 support the widespread belief that these suppliers reaped massive additiona= l=20 revenue by manipulating the market. ?????Spokesmen for the companies denied the accusation. ?????The study prepared for a filing with federal regulators today is=20 central to Cal-ISO's efforts to seek reimbursement for what it considers=20 excessive charges by electricity suppliers during the state's energy crisis= . ?????This might be the first time we told them the total impact and=20 magnitude [of the overcharging] said Anjali Sheffrin Cal-ISO's director = of=20 market analysis. We think the entire amount deserves consideration for=20 refunds. ?????Using confidential bidding data on tens of thousands of electricity=20 sales Cal-ISO found that five companies that together supply about 30% of= =20 the power delivered to customers of the state's investor-owned utilities=20 engaged in two types of behavior that tended to push up prices: ?????* They effectively withheld supplies by bidding at excessive prices= =20 even though they could have made some money selling more electricity. ?????* Less frequently they had power generation available but did not bid= =20 at all. ?????The study concluded that energy suppliers commonly offered their=20 electricity at twice their cost. For example Sheffrin said the average=20 markup in August was 100% during peak hours. ?????A spokeswoman at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission which=20 oversees wholesale electricity pricing across the country declined to=20 comment Wednesday saying This is part of an ongoing proceeding. ?????FERC member William L. Massey who has considered previous commission= =20 actions on refunds to be inadequate said it would be improper for him to= =20 comment on a report that has not yet been filed. But when told of the=20 $5.5-billion total Massey said: That doesn't shock me in any way. ?????Prices over the past 10 months in California have greatly exceeded th= e=20 federal standards of just and reasonable prices and I think they have=20 exceeded the standards by possibly billions of dollars he said. ?????Cal-ISO which oversees grid operations and an emergency energy market= =20 previously detailed $550 million in alleged overcharges for December and=20 January and asked FERC for refunds. But the commission has proposed refunds= =20 of only a tiny fraction of that amount. ?????The study covered five major in-state power suppliers--Reliant Energy= =20 Dynegy Williams/AES Duke Energy and Mirant formerly Southern Energy--plu= s=20 16 power importers all of which deliver power to customers of Pacific Gas = &=20 Electric Co. Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric Co. ?????All [21] overcharged but some excessively and some by moderate=20 amounts Sheffrin said. ?????Cal-ISO's public filing will quantify the alleged overcharging by each= =20 company but the companies will be identified only by a number. The code wi= ll=20 be provided to FERC Sheffrin said and Cal-ISO lawyers will determine how= =20 much information about the companies will be made public. ?????State U.S. Investigations ?????California electricity markets and the companies that buy and sell pow= er=20 in the state have been the subject of several investigations by state and= =20 federal authorities since wholesale electricity prices first skyrocketed in= =20 May. ?????Electricity suppliers have repeatedly denied manipulating the Californ= ia=20 market in any way whether through above-cost bidding in spot markets or=20 through physical withholding of electricity to drive up prices. ?????Reliant Energy is cooperating with FERC's requests for more data and i= s=20 confident the commission will conclude that prices charged by Reliant were= =20 justified said Joe Bob Perkins president of the Houston-based company. ?????Perkins also bitterly disputed charges that Reliant has shut down unit= s=20 so that it can earn bigger profits on the power sold by the remaining plant= s.=20 These charges have been leveled against all of the power-plant owners in th= e=20 state. ?????Reliant Vice President John Stout said Cal-ISO's calculations typicall= y=20 don't include such fixed costs as salaries taxes and the interest on bonds= =20 they sold to finance their power plants which they acquired under terms of= =20 the state's landmark 1996 deregulation law. ?????In addition he said many high-priced power days have resulted from= =20 buyers bidding against each other for scarce supplies rather than sellers= =20 charging excessive amounts--like a house price being driven far above the= =20 listing price in a hot real estate market. ?????Williams Energy Services a trading company that markets most of the= =20 power produced by plants owned by AES also says it will be exonerated by= =20 FERC once the commission examines documentation being submitted said Paula= =20 Hill-Collins spokeswoman for the Tulsa Okla. company. ?????FERC has the obligation to investigate when these accusations are=20 made Hill-Collins said. This is just a process of justification not=20 necessarily proof of guilt. ?????Williams/AES was recently ordered by FERC to prove that it did not tak= e=20 generating units out of service last year to drive up electricity prices o= r=20 refund $10.8 million to California utilities. ?????During the period studied suppliers sold electricity in the Californi= a=20 Power Exchange to Southern California Edison PG&E and San Diego Gas &=20 Electric Co. and in a backup market for last-minute electricity operated by= =20 Cal-ISO. But sky-high prices plunged Edison and PG&E deeply into debt and= =20 most suppliers stopped selling to them in January forcing the state=20 Department of Water Resources to step in as the primary electricity buyer f= or=20 the three big utilities' 27 million customers. ?????The Cal-ISO study first summarized at an energy conference last week = at=20 UC Berkeley but not otherwise publicized concluded that the companies=20 exercised so-called market power to pump up electricity prices. ?????Severin Borenstein director of the Energy Institute at Berkeley said= =20 Cal-ISO's study is consistent with his research examining pricing practices= =20 in 2000. ?????We found several billion dollars . . . in departures from competitive= =20 pricing he said. When the market was tight this summer they were able t= o=20 push up prices and they did. ?????The early warning signs of electricity price spikes the study found= =20 appeared in May after two years of relatively stable prices of $30 to $40 p= er=20 megawatt-hour under deregulation. Prices went up during the summer dipped = in=20 September and October with lower demand then took off in November and=20 December as weather turned cold and the price of natural gas which is used= =20 to generate much of the state's electricity reached record levels. ?????There were plant outages and demand and supply became close Sheffr= in=20 said. Whatever price they bid had to be taken and market power asserted= =20 itself. ?????Cal-ISO found that $3 billion of the alleged overcharges occurred=20 between May and November. ?????On Friday federal regulators ordered six wholesale power suppliers to= =20 refund $55 million to California if they cannot justify prices charged in= =20 February. The refund was limited to power sold that month in excess of $430= =20 per megawatt-hour during Stage 3 power alerts when supplies are so tight= =20 that rolling blackouts are threatened. (One megawatt-hour is enough=20 electricity to supply 750 typical homes for an hour.) ?????The previous week FERC ordered 13 suppliers to justify or refund $69= =20 million for power sold in January at prices above $273 per megawatt-hour. ?????Massey opposed the potential refunds as too low because they were=20 limited to hours in which a Stage 3 power emergency was in place and becaus= e=20 the benchmark price set for each month was too high--combining to exempt mo= re=20 than 70000 transactions from scrutiny. ?????We're still looking for our lost wallet under the lamppost which is= =20 Stage 3 alerts said Massey one of three commissioners on the five-member= =20 board (two seats are vacant). ?????Generators have been given the free and clear he said. ?????These tinkling little refunds they have come out with recently are=20 almost a joke said Cal-ISO board member Mike Florio senior attorney at t= he=20 Utility Reform Network. ?????Resisting Price Caps ?????Cal-ISO contends that the last 10 months have proved that generators c= an=20 no longer be allowed to receive electricity prices that are dictated by wha= t=20 the market will bear. ?????FERC granted market-based rate authority on each of these suppliers'= =20 own showing that they could not manipulate prices yet their actions have= =20 shown the contrary Sheffrin said.

Unseasonable heat tapered off. The operators of the= =20 statewide power grid relaxed their state of emergency. ?????But plenty of ominous signs remained. Many small producers remained sh= ut=20 down skeptical about Gov. Gray Davis' plan for utilities to pay them. ?????State Controller Kathleen Connell issued a sharp warning about the hig= h=20 cost of the state's foray into the power business and announced that she wi= ll=20 block an administration request that she transfer $5.6 billion into an=20 account that could be tapped to pay for state purchases of electricity. ?????And a report from the administration summarizing contracts between Dav= is=20 and independent power generators showed that the state has signed contracts= =20 for only 2247 megawatts of electricity significantly less than the 6000 = to=20 7000 megawatts previously claimed. ?????While there are agreements in principle for the full amount the repor= t=20 notes that generators can back out of the contracts for a variety of reason= s=20 including the state's failure to sell bonds to finance power purchased by= =20 July 1. The Legislature has approved plans to sell $10 billion in bonds bu= t=20 none have yet been issued. ?????We are exposed enormously this summer Senate Energy Committee=20 chairwoman Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey) said after looking at the report.= =20 We owe the people the truth about how difficult this summer is going to be= .=20 We don't have a power fairy. ?????Perhaps most significant the report suggests that the contracts fall= =20 significantly short of Davis' stated goal of buying no more than 5% of the= =20 state's summer needs on the spot electricity market where prices can be ma= ny=20 times those of long-term contracts. ?????After reading the report Frank Wolak a Stanford University economist= =20 who studies the California electricity market said the numbers suggested= =20 that the state's long-term contracts will cover less than half of what the= =20 state will need this summer. ?????We're definitely short this summer next summer and the summer of=20 2003 he said. ?????California was forced to start buying electricity in December--at a co= st=20 of $50 million a day--because producers refused to sell to Southern=20 California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric. The two utilities amassed=20 billions of dollars in debt when prices for wholesale power soared on the= =20 spot market. ?????Vikram Budhraja a consultant retained by Davis to negotiate deals wit= h=20 generators said the report represents a work in progress.

He said the state needs to take over the utilities' contrac= ts=20 with alternative energy providers to ensure they stay in business and sign= =20 new contracts for 1500 megawatts of new wind power--the cheapest fastest= =20 and cleanest source of new supply. ?????Davis had proposed a formula Tuesday to force private utilities to pay= =20 the alternative producers some of which have not been paid since November.= =20 But some of them warned Wednesday that Davis' plan offers them little=20 incentive to turn on their generators. ?????Alternative energy producers supply more than a quarter of the=20 electricity consumed in California. ?????Many producers generate electricity from wind sun and geothermal=20 sources. But most of them generate power using natural gas--and the cost of= =20 natural gas has been soaring. Several natural gas users said Davis' plan= =20 which caps rates won't cover their fuel costs. ?????Davis assumes that the price of natural gas will fall. But small=20 generators say they don't have sufficient purchasing power or sophisticatio= n=20 to gamble on future prices. ?????The Public Utilities Commission is expected to approve Davis' proposal= =20 next week. It offers producers two choices: 7.9 cents a kilowatt-hour if th= ey=20 agree to supply power for five years or 6.9 cents a kilowatt-hour over 10= =20 years. ?????The price of natural gas is higher than that said Marty Quinn=20 executive vice president and chief operating officer of Ridgewood Power LLC= =20 which owns three natural gas-fired co-generation plants. If we operate=20 we'll lose money. ?????Ridgewood is not operating having been cut off by gas suppliers.

Davis's Plan To Power California --- State's Outlays for Electricity May Be Hard to Recover Without Rate Increases --- Betting on Long-Term Deals ------------------------ Breakthrough made in rescue of PG&E State ready to pay $7 billion for lines By Steve Geissinger SACRAMENTO BUREAU SACRAMENTO -- Signaling a breakthrough in secret energy crisis talks the Davis administration disclosed Tuesday it may announce the framework of a pact to rescue the teetering Pacific Gas and Electric Co. next week. Things are going very well said Steve Maviglio a spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis. The state appears to be poised to pay at least $7 billion -- and possibly billions more -- for PG&E's high-voltage transmission lines as part of a deal to financially renovate the north-state utility according to sources familiar with the negotiations. But consumer advocates insisted that even the $7 billion price is too much to pay. And experts warned that a deal with PG&E will be more complex than with other utilities. PG&E representatives declined comment in keeping with their policy on the talks even though the Davis administration said an announcement could come as early as next week or the following week. The new timetable for an announcement was substantially sooner than in Davis' original forecast. Until late last week PG&E was still resisting the sale of its power grid despite the fact that Davis had announced the framework of an agreement with Southern California Edison. Davis expects to soon announce a similar deal with the San Diego Gas and Electric Co. However any such deal still would need federal approval. The investor-owned utilities trapped between high wholesale costs and lower regulated retail rates amassed nearly $13 billion in debts and were unable to buy electricity this winter. With the onset of rolling blackouts the state began brokering billions of dollars in emergency short- and long-term power purchases. Davis' strategy to ease the energy price and supply crisis includes bolstering both conservation and generation while fiscally refurbishing the nearly bankrupt utilities. As part of the rescue deal the utilities would have to drop legal actions seeking dramatically higher electricity bills environmentally shield wildlands they own sell power from their generators to Californians for the next decade and secure help with their debts from their parent companies. Together with the cash infusion from the sale of their power 26000-mile power grids the utilities would be allowed to sell bonds to raise funds and use customer money to pay them off. The state would upgrade the high-voltage lines and lease them back to the utilities for operation. In a reflection of the negotiations with the three utilities a Davis administration official said the deal with PG&E is proving to be more complex than with the other firms. Though PG&E finally agreed late last week to sell its transmission grid the utility apparently wants more than the $7 billion that Davis has offered according to sources. The figure is more than twice the book amount or the value placed on the system for purposes of accounting. And that's the markup that lured Edison into an agreement to sell its smaller portion of the transmission grid for $2.8 billion. But PG&E which fears an erosion of its economic base may be asking as much as $10 billion. Due to complexities in the state's 1996 deregulation of the industry PG&E is more likely to lose revenue than Edison as a result of selling its transmission lines according to experts. Big customers might be able to bypass the utility's remaining local distribution lines thereby eroding its customer base. Therefore the utility may view bankruptcy and sale of its transmission lines to the highest bidder as a potentially attractive alternative to selling its share of the grid to the state at too low a price. ---- El Paso Energy closes six valley power plants Filed: 03/07/2001 By CHIP POWER Californian staff writer e-mail: ppower@bakersfield.com El Paso Energy citing non-payment from Pacific Gas & Electric Co. said it has shut down six cogeneration plants this week. The smaller plants produced about 175 megawatts of electricity and are located primarily in the San Joaquin Valley said company spokesman Mel Scott. A megawatt can supply power to 1000 homes. At least 10 plants have closed in the past two weeks as a result of non-payment according to the state Independent System Operator which manages most of the state's electrical distribution. The El Paso Energy plants are operated with various partners and had not been compensated for December January and February deliveries said Scott. He said he did not know the total amount due but said the plants would be closed until PG&E's credit worthiness is improved. A cogeneration plant common in oil fields simultaneously produces heat energy and electrical or mechanical power from the same fuel in the same facility. Typically it produces electricity and steam which can be deployed to enhance oil recovery. Kern County is the state's leading oil-producing county. El Paso owns or has interests in more than 40000 miles of interstate and intrastate pipeline connecting the nation's principal natural gas supply regions to the five largest consuming regions in the United States namely the Gulf Coast California the Northeast the Midwest and the Southeast. El Paso closed up 99 cents on Tuesday or 1.4 percent at $71.49. The Houston-based company's stock price has ranged between $36.31 and $75.30 in the last 52 weeks. ---- Still undecided: Who'll pay DWR for electricity By Karen Gaudette ASSOCIATED PRESS SAN FRANCISCO -- The price tag is $3.2 billion and counting for electricity bought by the state Department of Water Resources for the customers of two nearly bankrupt utilities. Pacific Gas and Electric Co. Southern California Edison and the state disagree over how the DWR eventually will be reimbursed for its purchases on the expensive last-minute power market. So do the state power regulators who have the final call over who gets the money when. Under a recent law the DWR went into the electricity-buying business to help keep the two utilities from sinking further into their $13 billion debt. The state plans to retrieve the money by selling $10 billion in revenue bonds. The utilities continue to collect ratepayer dollars on that electricity which the bill's author Assemblyman Fred Keeley D-Boulder Creek says is meant to help them begin paying down their debt. In a recent letter however DWR officials requested that the state Public Utilities Commission order that a portion of that money be diverted to the state. But after the utilities subtract the costs of generating electricity payments to environmentally friendly power plants and other expenses there is no money left from ratepayer dollars to give to the DWR without sinking further into debt PG&E spokesman Ron Low said Tuesday. If it passed along money to the DWR our undercollection would grow by about $2.4 billion by the end of the year Low said. The commission unable to agree on the best course of action left the issue untouched at its last meeting but expects to revisit the issue when it meets this morning. Commissioner Richard Bilas is proposing an alternate plan that would have the DWR set its own revenue requirements that would be passed on to ratepayers. The PUC also is expected to respond to complaints from laid-off workers and customers that layoffs by utilities to cut costs have been hurting service. Commissioner Carl Wood warned at the last meeting that failure to provide safe and reliable service could mean fines for the utilities. Representatives from electrical workers unions the PUC and the utilities were to discuss the issue Tuesday afternoon. I don't think we believe that utilities can find a way out of their problems by laying off workers said Mindy Spatt a spokeswoman with the Utility Reform Network. We think consumers deserve safe and reliable service and we think they deserve it at a reasonable price. ---- State Taxpayers In Dark on Details Of Energy Deal David Lazarus Chronicle Staff Writer Wednesday March 7 2001 2001 San Francisco Chronicle Few people would purchase a car simply because the dealer said ''Trust me it's a great deal.'' Yet Gov. Gray Davis essentially is telling Californians just that about dozens of long-term power contracts. Because of confidentiality agreements with power companies the governor has revealed only scant details about the state's multibillion-dollar contracts for electricity over the next 10 years. Gov. Davis has our money and we can't see how he's spending it said Doug Heller a spokesman for the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in Santa Monica. We've been locked out of the room. Neither Davis nor power companies would divulge specific details about the price duration or scope of individual contracts. Each cited secrecy clauses that the governor's office said had been desired by both sides. What consumers do know is this: -- California has signed 40 contracts and tentative accords valued at about $40 billion to secure enough power to light 9 million homes over the next decade. -- The average purchase price of each deal is $69 per megawatt hour -- well above the $30 to $40 charged by power generators before California's energy market went haywire last summer. -- If as is widely expected wholesale power prices fall in years ahead the state nevertheless will be locked into paying above-market rates for electricity. But it is not known which generator agreed to part with the most power at the cheapest level or the full range of the prices in concocting the $69 average. Moreover it is unclear how shrewdly the state negotiated with taxpayer money in securing power on behalf of cash-strapped utilities. These agreements are the bedrock of our long-term energy policy Davis said Monday in announcing the deals. The governor's office defended the murky nature of the contracts yesterday. It's a business transaction in which private corporate information is included said Steve Maviglio a spokesman for Davis. That's the kind of information that never gets revealed. While additional elements of the contracts will be publicized in coming months he said the contracts themselves will remain a secret. You'll never see all the details Maviglio said. This did not sit well with many observers. It's a breach of public trust said Daniel Bacon a San Francisco attorney specializing in business law. A public servant spending public money shouldn't be able to keep the spending secret. But Gary Ackerman executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum an energy-industry association in Menlo Park called confidentiality agreements a necessary evil in transactions like this. He explained that no power company would agree to a long-term contract if rival firms could learn the terms of the accord. The company would be losing too much of its competitive edge in the marketplace Ackerman said. At the same time he noted that secrecy allowed the buyer -- in this case California taxpayers -- to secure more favorable terms with individual sellers. A high price with one generator would not necessarily be sought by all power providers. Still the fact that public funds are being used makes confidentiality in this case a different matter than say Cisco Systems' quietly negotiating to take over yet another tech rival. The public is in a very awkward position said Michael Shames executive director of the Utility Consumers' Action Network in San Diego. It has to rely on the good word and expertise of the governor and he has yet to demonstrate that he has expertise or good word in this field. Shames likened consumers to passengers in a plane being flown by a pilot without a license to fly. But what choice do we have? he asked. I don't see many other options available right now. There's the rub. No matter how bad a deal California may have cut to help meet its energy demands the alternative -- blackouts disruptions economic catastrophe -- is far far worse. On the other hand it already appears that the new contracts will not shield Californians from the threat of daily outages this summer when demand surges. Davis said only about 60 percent of the state's summertime electricity needs so far had been met. Part of the reason is that many power companies already have contracted for their output this year. Duke Energy said this was why it would not begin its nine-year contract with California until 2002 while Williams Cos. said it would only gradually increase the amount of available wattage in its 10-year contract. Both companies meanwhile will continue to profit this summer by selling into the volatile spot market where wholesale power went for as much as $1 500 per megawatt hour last year. You can't sell all your power into long-term contracts said Paula Hall- Collins a Williams spokeswoman. You save some for the spot market. Consumer groups worry that consumers will be hammered again this summer with sky-high power prices and then get nailed down the road by contracts for above-market rates. If we could look at the terms of the deals we'd see that California is being gouged for 10 years said Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights. But the governor doesn't want us to see that. Ackerman of the Western Power Trading Forum said the state had gotten the best rates it could under current market conditions. California went for long-term contracts when everyone else moved in as well he said. Californians are paying a price for not acting sooner. ---- Lawmakers pitch fixes for region's energy woes By David Whitney Bee Washington Bureau (Published March 7 2001) WASHINGTON -- California members of Congress pleaded for everything from wholesale price caps to extending daylight-saving time an extra hour to help the region cope this summer with its persistent electricity shortage but none of the ideas seemed to catch fire at a House hearing Tuesday. People will die in California because of this crisis Rep. Brad Sherman a Los Angeles-area Republican warned the House Energy and Commerce Committee. Sherman testified that his idea for saving lives is to extend daylight-saving time by an extra hour so that there would be more daylight at the end of the day when power consumption surges. One of the peak demand periods for electricity occurs between 5 p.m. and 8 p.m. when the sun sets and people come home from work Sherman testified. If people come home and it is light out there is less of an inclination to turn a light on. Sherman said the state Legislature has called for congressional approval for states to be given authority to extend daylight-saving time and he cited analyses by the California Energy Commission and other agencies suggesting that it could cut power consumption by 1 percent to 2 percent. Sherman who was one of about a dozen California lawmakers presenting their views on the energy squeeze drew no questions from committee leaders about what his legislation might do to everything from airline schedules to television programming if West Coast states didn't agree on the same time standard. Most of the committee's questioning was on the more popular idea proposed by several California and Western lawmakers primarily Democrats to require the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to impose caps on wholesale electricity prices that have gone wild because of a regional power shortage. Rep. Bob Filner D-San Diego charged that the price spiral has little to do with power shortages but a lot to do with a small cartel of generators bilking ratepayers. Rep. Jay Inslee D-Wash. said he brought up the idea of regional price caps with President Bush who was initially skeptical. But Inslee said that Bush warmed to the idea after being told that protections could be built into the caps so as not to discourage construction of new power plants. Upon hearing that Inslee said Bush invited him to meet with the president's Cabinet-level task force led by Vice President Dick Cheney on a national energy strategy. But Inslee said he can't get the group to meet with him. It's very disappointing Inslee said. Tuesday's hearing was part of a series the panel is holding on the California crisis so far without any emerging consensus on what if anything Congress should do. ---- Power plan called wrong Wall Street analysts say the governor's approach to the problem avoids the issue that caused the imbalance. March 7 2001 By DON THOMPSON The Associated Press SACRAMENTO California's scramble to insulate consumers from the soaring price of electricity may add to the state's power problems this summer Wall Street analysts said Tuesday. Gov. Gray Davis' emphasis on buying utilities' transmission lines and negotiating long-term power contracts to help ease their debts skirts the deep imbalance between wholesale and market rates that led to the state's power problems in the first place they said. In the long run it doesn't solve anything said Michael Worms an industry analyst for Gerard Klauer Mattison & Co. In the long run you need to send the right price signals to consumers which will create its own conservation signals. Unfortunately customers were shielded from that in California. Davis said Monday that the state's first contracts to buy electricity for two financially struggling utilities will provide only about two-thirds of the power needed on a typical summer day forcing Californians to cut power use at least 10 percent to avoid blackouts. Since early January the state has been buying one- third of the power Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric Co. customers need. The two utilities denied credit by suppliers say they have lost nearly $14 billion due to soaring wholesale electricity prices that the state's industry-deregulation law says they cannot pass on to consumers. The keepers of the state power grid had enough electricity Tuesday to avoid declaring an electricity alert but have faced an almost-daily scramble for weeks due to a tight supply and high wholesale prices. Several wholesale and retail rate proposals are circulating. Among them: Free-market advocates such as Worms want an immediate end to the deregulation-imposed retail rate freeze on Edison and PG&E that will expire next year. Davis wants a Western price cap of $100 per megawatt hour on power generators he says have been prof iteering from California's short energy supply. The Bush administration and Federal Energy Regulatory Commission are cool to that idea. In December FERC imposed a soft cap of $150 per megawatt hour on wholesale rates in the state and required suppliers to justify any higher prices they charge. Consumer groups such as The Utility Reform Network or TURN want regulated rates for residential and small-business customers but free-market rates for large industrial customers which sought deregulation in the first place. TURN also advocates a tiered rate structure with higher rates for consumers who use more than a reasonable amount of electricity each month. Assembly Republicans say electricity and natural-gas prices will fall naturally if the state increases supply mainly by making it easier to build plants and pipelines. Right now you're sort of sitting partially with regulation and part with the free market said Paul Fremont an analyst with Jefferies & Co. Both these systems work. It's sort of that in-between system that you have in Califor nia that doesn't appear to be working. The system discourages generators from building new power plants because they aren't guaranteed a profit and it doesn't do enough to discourage power use by consumers because the price they pay doesn't reflect the true cost of power Fremont said. I don't think people here have much faith in the market and why should they? countered TURN's Mindy Spatt. I think there are probably better ways of encouraging consumers to conserve than by gouging them. Davis insists the crisis can be resolved without raising rates for Edison and PG&E customers beyond the existing rate structure. In January state regulators imposed temporary rate hikes of 7 to 15 percent on Edison and PG&E customers. The Legislature and Davis extended the increases for up to a decade to help pay back the estimated $10 billion in power buying the state expects to do for Edison and PG&E over the next several years and finance its purchase of the power lines owned by the two companies and San Diego Gas & Electric. Rates were already scheduled to increase next year for Edison and PG&E customers. Under the 1996 deregulation law the pair's ratepayers saw a 10 percent rate reduction but only until early 2002. That rate cut will likely expire as planned Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio has said. Davis wants those rates to cover not only the traditional cost of generating transporting and distributing power but the added cost of paying off the two utilities' massive debt and buying their transmission lines said Assemblyman Fred Keeley D-Boulder Creek the Assembly's chief power negotiator. Yet Davis has indirectly addressed the rate imbalance by signing legislation that will let regulators raise consumer rates if necessary Keeley said. The governor and lawmakers are in effect spreading out rate increases over a decade by using long-term revenue bonds to buy power for the nearly bankrupt utilities said Severin Borenstein director of the University of California Energy Institute. At some point we have to deal with the reality that all of the power that we buy has to be paid for by somebody - it's either going to come from taxpayers or it's going to come from ratepayers Bor enstein said. Raising rates now would get us a lot of conservation. Davis also wants financial incentives for conservation and power-plant construction in time to make a difference this summer. Our mouths were agape at the rapid timetable Keeley said. Legislators are rushing to pass those incentives by month's end he said allowing three months for consumers and suppliers to act before the heat of summer. Among bills considered Tuesday the Senate Energy Committee approved legislation to accelerate the siting of power plants. It also was considering a proposal to restructure rates for generators that use renewable energy to provide about 30 percent of the state's electricity. ---- Bill to Cut Some Power Prices Stalls Energy: Democrats balk at varying payment levels for alternative generators. By DAN MORAIN JULIE TAMAKI Times Staff Writers SACRAMENTO--Legislation aimed at cutting prices for more than a fourth of the power consumed in California stalled Tuesday as Democrats questioned why a few alternative energy generators--some of them campaign donors--stood to receive higher payments than others. Lawmakers working to unravel California's energy mess have been negotiating for weeks in an effort to cut the price paid to more than 600 generators of alternative power by more than half to below 8 cents a kilowatt-hour. Those alternative generators' contracts with utilities have shot up in recent months because of a rise in the price of natural gas. The cash-strapped corporations have suspended or made partial payments to the generators over the last few months causing many to shut down or reduce their outputs. But even as the lawmakers reached agreement that pushed the average price to near the 8-cent level per kilowatt-hour some generators would have received higher prices under the bill by state Sen. Jim Battin (R-La Quinta). Some of the generators that stood to benefit had donated to Battin's campaigns. One--Windtec Inc.--gave Battin a $20000 campaign donation in 1999. Others contributed from $3000 and $5000 last year. Battin acknowledged that he has received campaign contributions from some wind power generators but said there is no connection between the donations and the bill's provisions. It is illegal it is unethical and it's not how I do business he said. Battin noted that 25% of the state's alternative energy producers are in his district. As Democrats on the Senate Energy Committee blocked the bill Battin warned that some alternative energy producers might react to the delay by trying to force Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric into bankruptcy. We will be the cause of bankruptcy Battin said. That prompted Energy Committee Chairwoman Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey) to retort: I'm really tired of being threatened with bankruptcy. Alternative energy producers including those that use wind solar power biomass and other means produce 27% of the energy used in California. They sell the electricity to the utilities which in turn transmit it to retail consumers. But with the utilities facing multibillion-dollar debts the alternative energy producers under contract with Edison have not been paid since November. Scores of alternative energy producers supported the measure. Edison International and the San Francisco-based consumer group the Utility Reform Network opposed it. Michael Florio of the Utility Reform group said the deal could result in higher consumer prices an Edison representative said the same thing. Battin and Assemblyman Fred Keeley (D-Boulder Creek) worked out an arrangement with many of the generators. Keeley took the lead in the early negotiations and then turned to Battin to introduce the legislation SB 47X. Rather convoluted language would have allowed higher payments to a select few generators that produce electricity from wind and biomass. Most of California's wind suppliers for instance would have received about 6 cents per kilowatt-hour. But a handful of them about half a dozen wind farms--mostly in the Palm Springs area represented by Battin--would have received 7.8 cents. Battin contends that other wind producers receive additional payments that boost them to the same level as Windtec and others that would get the higher payments. They get the same deal Battin said of the handful of generators that would benefit from the provisions he added to the bill. In California's overall energy market the amount of money that would have flowed to the favored generators is minor. But the added prices that would have been paid to the generators would have translated to at least $19 million in the next five years to be absorbed by Southern California Edison customers according to one analysis. Also Tuesday more details were disclosed about another leg of the state's effort to escape from the energy crunch--the deals with large power generators to supply electricity to California for as long as 10 years. Those arrangements were announced by Gov. Gray Davis Monday as the bedrock of California's energy policy. But some consumer advocates warned that the deals could lock the state into excessively high-priced contracts. S. David Freeman the general manager of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and Davis' negotiator said that the state guarded against that by varying the time spans of its deals. About 6000 megawatts are expected to be available this summer about one-third of the energy needed by the state Freeman said. The amount of power under contract swells until more than 9000 megawatts are contracted in 2004 half of the needed amount before dipping to 8000 megawatts in 2010. What we're doing here is what everybody said had to be done Freeman said. We deliberately bought 50% so we'd have a good mix between long-term contracts which may turn out to be somewhat higher or somewhat lower than the spot market and purchases on the spot market. ---- PG&E could face mutiny on outages: SMUD others may balk if utility orders summer blackouts By Carrie Peyton Bee Staff Writer (Published March 7 2001) Sacramento's electric utility wants out of a deal that imposes rolling blackouts locally on PG&E's command. So do a lot of other utilities. They've been writing letters lobbying lawmakers and launching informal talks with Pacific Gas and Electric Co. to get off the hook before summer. Who dodges the blackout bullet is going to play out as a political hot button around the state said George Fraser head of the Northern California Power Agency a coalition of municipal utilities. In Sacramento the next volley is expected soon with the Sacramento Municipal Utility District reportedly poised to notify PG&E that it will no longer black out homes and businesses on the larger utility's command. We are absolutely trying to fight off the requirement for rolling blackouts for the Sacramento area said Linda Davis one of seven elected members of the SMUD board of directors. Saying they don't want to be dragged down by somebody else's problems two Southern California utilities have written grid operators asking to be exempted from any blackouts caused by PG&E's or Southern California Edison's financial woes. But in PG&E's view California is in an energy crisis (and) ... we're all in this together said spokesman John Nelson. The maneuvering comes amid bleak forecasts for power supplies this summer. Although Gov. Gray Davis has said conservation new power plants and moderate weather could avert blackouts officials at the Independent System Operator which runs much of California's grid expect frequent rotating outages. One consulting firm Cambridge Energy Research Associates predicts 20 hours of rolling blackouts during July and August and about 200 hours of especially intense calls for voluntary cutbacks. Before blackouts hit the jockeying over just whose lights air conditioners and assembly lines will be shut down is growing. The outcome could affect millions of people statewide. The state Public Utilities Commission is probing rolling blackout programs run by the for-profit utilities it regulates including PG&E and Edison. A PUC analysis has suggested that PG&E's program which currently exempts about 40 percent of its customers should spread the burden more broadly. For example it said 1.9 million homes and businesses are spared just because they share a circuit with a customer deemed essential. But not-for-profit utilities such as SMUD which answer to their own elected boards or city councils have other worries. Many have already lined up their power supplies for summer. Some have raised rates or are considering raising rates. Some have taken extra conservation steps. They think those preparations ought to give them leverage to ease blackout clauses in their contracts with PG&E. SMUD general manager Jan Schori is going to use every avenue ... any avenue to put pressure on including lobbying the ISO the governor and others said utility director Davis. The Northern California Power Agency a joint-powers authority that owns and operates power plants for municipal utilities has begun informal negotiations with PG&E to change blackout rules according to Fraser its top executive. It is preparing to write PG&E asking that its members be exempted from outages altogether. Failing that it wants them to face fewer outages or to be compensated for cutting off power he said. At SMUD the utility board has met in closed session to discuss exactly what it is required to do during electric emergencies under terms of the interconnection contract that links SMUD's lines to PG&E's. The contracts are being inspected with a fine-tooth comb said SMUD director Howard Posner. Schori declined to comment on any specifics. Sources indicated that the main option being considered is notifying PG&E that because of changed circumstances SMUD believes it no longer is required to routinely comply with outage requests. Other options being explored include re-negotiating existing agreements with PG&E. Posner said that ever since two days of rolling blackouts in January constituents have been asking him  'Why are we participating when we're not the problem?' And I don't have a good answer to that. Several directors said SMUD has already spent a lot of money -- and is considering 16 percent rate increases -- to ensure that it has enough electricity under contract to meet its customers' summer demands. They believe PG&E should do the same. We're almost like a David against Goliath here said board vice president Genevieve Shiroma. The huge investor-owned utilities next door have severe problems that they need to get under control. In addition SMUD plans to argue that because it can cut usage through its Peak Corps program which remotely turns off air conditioners at volunteer households it has already done its part without rotating outages director Davis said. PG&E believes the interconnection agreements that govern smaller utilities' ties to its transmission lines have benefits and burdens to both sides said Nelson. It wouldn't be fair or good policy for just one provision to be altered without taking a look at how that affects the entire contract he said. Interconnection contracts generally have clauses that require utilities to help each other out to avert greater emergencies. Sometimes reducing demand -- called load shedding -- can be the only way to stabilize the electric grid in the seconds after a major power plant or transmission line fails. It's been around in the electrical fabric forever said Jim Pope head of Silicon Valley Power Santa Clara's city-run utility. In addition to legal requirements you have a moral obligation so you don't bring the system to collapse. Like other city-run utilities Silicon Valley Power has a contract with PG&E that requires it to shed load during an electric emergency. But its contract allows it to work with big users to reduce their demand so no one has to be completely shut off. Such agreements formed long before deregulation when PG&E ran the north state's grid now are complicated by the 1997 creation of the state Independent System Operator. The ISO today runs pieces of the grid owned by PG&E Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric Co. If it believes power use is about to surge past supply potentially triggering a grid collapse across the western United States the ISO notifies the three utilities that they have to shed a certain number of megawatts. The big utilities meet that requirement two ways. They cut circuits to some of their own customers and they tell smaller connected utilities to cut a proportionate share. In Northern California about 80 percent of the outages are borne by PG&E customers and the rest by customers of SMUD and other municipal utilities and irrigation districts. In one sense we are all in this together. If SMUD were in danger of going down we would hope others would help us out said SMUD's Posner. But that's if we're in danger from circumstances beyond our control not from mismanagement or lack of financial wherewithal. It is unclear what penalties if any a utility would face for violating an interconnection agreement. In the long run the issue would be fought either in the courts or before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission grid officials said. As a practical matter in the seconds when the risk to the grid is greatest if one utility refused to shed load the ISO would probably solve to problem by calling on PG&E Edison or others who are willing to make deeper cutbacks they said. ---- PUC to Decide Fate Of Utility Workers PG&E Edison want to trim costs by laying off thousands cutting service Bernadette Tansey Chronicle Staff Writer Wednesday March 7 2001 2001 San Francisco Chronicle State regulators are set to decide today whether debt-ridden Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern California Edison can conserve cash by laying off thousands of workers and letting service standards slip. Union officials who protested the layoffs before the California Public Utilities Commission warn that if the cuts go through neighborhoods hit by power outages could stay dark for hours and more customers could face busy signals when they call about their bills. An administrative law judge agreed advising the commission in February to order the utilities to restore 725 positions already cut and block the elimination of an additional 2125 jobs. Judge John Wong said PG&E and Edison have acknowledged the layoffs will not substantially improve their shaky financial condition which arose from skyrocketing wholesale electricity costs the utilities could not pass on to consumers under a rate cap. The savings would barely make a dent Wong said in his draft decision. The two companies together claim that their debt from power purchases amounts to more than $13 billion. PG&E says it has saved $18 million from the first wave of 325 layoffs. Wong's recommendation is already running into resistance on the PUC. Commissioner Richard Bilas said the five-member panel should not be micromanaging the utilities in a time of crisis. Bilas has proposed an alternate ruling that would allow the utilities to make the cuts but provide for PUC monitoring of service in case the commission wants to step in later. We're in a situation where the utilities are not collecting the revenues they need to operate and yet we may be guilty of not letting them cut expenses where they can cut expenses Bilas said. PG&E spokesman Jon Tremayne said savings from the layoffs are helping to keep electricity running and gas flowing. It keeps cash in our accounts so we can keep doing day-to-day business Tremayne said. In addition to the 325 positions dropped so far PG&E is proposing to cut an additional 675 during the next three to six months. The cuts affect temporary and contract workers who read meters handle new service hookups and replace equipment. PG&E has no plans to eliminate permanent positions. The company is struggling to keep up with a higher workload at its call center as customers deluge the lines with inquiries about their rising bills and the effects of deregulation. Calls to PG&E ballooned from 1.3 million in January 2000 to 2.3 million in January 2001. Bilas advocates granting PG&E's request to temporarily relax standards requiring the utility to respond swiftly to customer calls and to read customers' meters once a month. PG&E wants to read meters bimonthly and send bills based on the estimated use between readings. Discrepancies could be corrected later. Wong called those measures unacceptable. He said customers need to know immediately if their efforts to conserve power are working. Wong also said the utilities' own experts have said the workforce reductions will lengthen the time required to restore power after nonemergency equipment failure. Eric Wolfe communications director for the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 1245 said some customers have already been left without power overnight because PG&E is trying to avoid the use of overtime on nonemergency power outages. It hurts a lineman to walk away from the job leaving a customer without power Wolfe said. Tremayne said PG&E is trying to minimize overtime costs but denied the company has allowed customers to go without power out of financial concerns. He said crews were pulled out when darkness and falling trees made the work too dangerous. ---- Power prices could soar during the summer Posted at 10:35 p.m. PST Tuesday March 6 2001 BY STEVE JOHNSON Mercury News Unless Gov. Gray Davis arranges significantly more long-term electricity contracts or persuades people to turn off a lot more lights California's unpredictable spot market for power could wreak havoc this summer. Even with the 40 long-term deals announced by Davis on Monday experts interviewed Tuesday said up to 43 percent of the state's daily needs may have to come from this highly volatile market in which power is bought within a day of need. That could could prove hugely expensive because some spot market energy has cost five to six times what it would under the long-term contracts. It's widely expected that consumers ultimately would have to pay that tab which could amount to billions of dollars. And because that power won't be locked up in contracts there is no guarantee it will be available when it's needed which could lead to blackouts according to a recent report to the California Independent System Operator which oversees three-fourths of the state's power grid. ``The situation in California could reach catastrophic proportions'' the report concluded adding that unless things change dramatically ``it is a virtual certainty that peak demand will go unmet during many hot summer days.'' Steven Maviglio Davis' press secretary conceded Tuesday that the spot market could be troublesome. ``It's a major concern'' he said which is why the state is trying to line up more power contracts speed up power plant construction and promote conservation. During the normally hot month of August peak daily demand for power in the Independent System Operator's territory is expected to hit about 47700 megawatts -- enough for nearly 48 million homes. The state's three main utility firms generate about 8200 megawatts and have long-term contracts from wind solar and other energy sources for about 11700 megawatts more. That totals about 20000 megawatts. Add in the 7000 megawatts of long-term power that Davis has announced for this summer and the state is still nearly 21000 megawatts short. Costly proposition If all that power has to be obtained on the spot market the price could be high. On Friday last-minute purchases on the market averaged $411 per megawatt-hour compared to about $150 per megawatt-hour for all power obtained by the Independent System Operator and $69 per megawatt-hour on average under Davis' long-term contracts. It's possible that not all 21000 megawatts would have to be purchased on the market. Assuming Davis is successful in getting people to save 10 percent -- which could prove difficult -- conservation could reduce peak demand by nearly 5000 megawatts. California also might be able to trade for another 5000 megawatts with the federal government's Bonneville Power Administration and a hydroelectric operator in British Columbia said Arthur O'Donnell editor of California Energy Markets a trade publication. Under such deals those two outfits often send that much power to California when they don't need it and California returns the same amount or more when its demand is low. But O'Donnell said it wasn't clear whether 5000 megawatts would be available this summer because ``they still haven't gotten the snowpack they need in the Pacific Northwest'' which could limit that region's generating capacity. Still falling short Even if those hydropower imports are available and conservation works as Davis hopes it's likely California would still require the spot market for 11000 megawatts to meet the August demand. That's more than 20 percent of the state's overall power needs. ``All of the surrounding states are buying probably less than 5 percent at most of their energy on the spot market'' said Frank Wolak a Stanford economist who monitors electricity prices for the Independent System Operator. He worries about how much that power could cost and is disturbed that state officials haven't adequately addressed the issue. ``No one has any idea what they are going to do and that is part of the problem'' he said. Officials at Pacific Gas & Electric Co. are particularly concerned. They fear that their company -- which is nearing bankruptcy -- could get stuck for much of the spot market purchases by the Independent System Operator which has threatened to bill the utilities for the cost. Fearing the annual bill for that power could hit $2.4 billion this year PG&E wants the tab sent to the Department of Water Resources which also is buying power on the spot market for the state. But the Department of Water Resources has objected to that idea and the matter is expected to be heard today by the California Public Utilities Commission. ``We're looking for clarity on a number of issues'' regarding how the spot market will work ``and certainly that's one of them'' said Thomas Hannigan the water agency's director. ``I don't think anybody knows the answer of who's going to pay for it'' added PG&E spokesman John Nelson. But Nettie Hoge executive director of the Utility Reform Network in San Francisco said she suspects consumers ultimately will foot the bill. The unfortunate likelihood about spot market purchases is that ``ratepayers are responsible for all of it eventually'' Hoge said. ``It's a very big problem.'' ---- Power Plant Plans Cause Conflicts East county residents blast supervisors Jason B. Johnson Chronicle Staff Writer Wednesday March 7 2001 Industry dreams of building new power plants in east Contra Costa's hills are prompting an angry reaction among residents and elected officials who say they don't want more plants. The conflict was sparked by a vote by county supervisors yesterday to aggressively explore possible sites for new power plants throughout the county. The measure by Supervisors Mark DeSaulnier and Federal Glover which passed on a 4-to-0 vote directs the county administrator and Department of Community Development to compile a report on possible sites within 45 days. Supervisor Donna Gerber abstained after criticizing the plan for potentially repeating the same mistakes that plagued the state's energy deregulation effort by not considering how much energy the state region and county will need in future years and how much power is slated to come online. Gerber said alternative power sources such as solar should also be examined. A site drawing much attention is on top of a deposit of natural gas near the Concord Naval Weapons Station off Highway 4. The owners of 70 acres of land near the station recently formed a company Golden State Power Co. to pursue construction of at least one small peaker plant and a much larger facility capable of producing 600 megawatts. The site could hold up to three small 50-megawatt peaker plants and a larger 15-acre natural gas plant said Steve Thomas managing partner with Golden State. No land use applications have been filed. Thomas said 30 acres could be kept as open space to form a buffer around the project. Both (facilities) are state of the art said Thomas. We believe that the site is ideal. But east county residents at yesterday's meeting blasted the supervisorial measure and the power plant proposal complaining that more plants could put people's health at risk. The region already is home to six power plants. We're going to get a good dose of poor air quality and (negative) health conditions from this said Concord resident Evelyn Frietas. I think we need to stop and think about what we're doing to our quality of life. Dan Torres said the home he bought in 1995 at a new Bay Point development would be alarmingly close to the proposed Golden State site. It will be dragging emissions over our home said Torres. I didn't buy a home on that hill to be surrounded by power plants. There are six power plants in operation in east Contra Costa. Pittsburg already has two power plants and two more under construction. City Council members Frank Aiello and Yvonne Beals said the Antioch-Pittsburg area has done more than its share of energy production. Aiello said Pittsburg will soon produce enough energy to power three million homes in California. When is enough enough? asked Aiello. Pittsburg has shouldered responsibility for a land-fill and two more power plants. At some point you have to say enough. Beals said that while power plants have added millions to the city's general fund the negatives of additional plants could outweigh the benefits. I don't think that Pittsburg or east county should be the dumping ground for energy for California said Beals. ---- Supervisors set search for power plant sites The board also heard from the potential developers of a 650-megawatt plant between Bay Point and Concord By Thomas Peele TIMES STAFF WRITER MARTINEZ -- Contra Costa County supervisors took tentative steps Tuesday toward allowing the construction of at least one small power plant before summer ordering that its staff identify potential sites in unincorporated areas within seven weeks. The board voted 4-0 to search for locations. Third District Supervisor Donna Gerber abstained saying her colleagues lacked a comprehensive context'' to identify sites. I think the board knows just enough to be dangerous'' she said. Gerber said the county should examine the potential for additional power plants within its borders but not investigate individual sites yet. But Fourth District Supervisor Mark DeSaulnier said the action was necessary because of the energy crisis and because of Gov. Gray Davis' call for local governments to help speed the construction of so-called peaker plants before July and August. I wouldn't do this except under an emergency DeSaulnier said after the vote. There are unusual circumstances. We're not talking about putting this in a residential area. Fifth District Supervisor Federal Glover backed DeSaulnier but said he hoped for a location outside his heavily industrialized East County district. There's a lot of concern in East County as to the number of plants he said. DeSaulnier said though that the only logical place for a small plant remains the industrial belt'' stretching along the waterfront from West County to Antioch. He declined to provide specifics but said the only other potential site outside the industrial areas was the Concord Naval Weapons Station property. But he quickly added that he believes the U.S. Department of Defense would never go for it. Also DeSaulnier said he could not rule out the county building the plant itself and entering the electricity-selling market during peak demand times. Board Chairwoman Gayle Uilkema called that idea extremely premature and unlikely. That's a very powerful decision. I do not think we are ready'' she said. The California Energy Commission listed the Equilon refinery in Martinez as one of 32 potential peaker plant sites in the state last week. Peaker plants kick in during peak usage times. Davis called for their quick construction before the height of summer and its energy demand for air conditioning. Plants that generate as much as 50000 megawatts don't need Energy Commission approval. DeSaulnier said he believed a peaker plant could be built about a month after final approval. Supervisors also heard from the potential developers of a 650-megawatt plant between Bay Point and Concord. Walnut Creek commercial real estate developer Steve Thomas announced his intentions for the site north of Highway 4 last week. Construction could take two years. Eric Hasseltine a consultant representing Thomas and what he described as a brand new company for the site the Golden State Power Co. told supervisors that if they intended to speed peaker plant construction they should do what they can to expedite the larger plant. The Thomas site could house a peaker plant until the proposed larger one goes online. A large natural gas line passes under the site. DeSaulnier seemed cautious about the larger proposal which he had described last week as a good site. Uilkema too said she knew too little about it to comment. A resident who lives near the Thomas property asked the board to build it (the larger plant) closer to where you have industrial areas. You have to carefully consider the people who live nearby said Dan Torres 39. Evelyn Freitas of Concord said she lives downwind of the proposed site. Our air quality is going to be worse then it is now she said. Gerber played on the environmental issues saying the county already ranks second statewide to Los Angeles in volume of hazardous materials and amount of electrical generation. ---- Peter Schrag: California's $90 billion infrastructure gap (Published March 7 2001) By now California's surreal energy mess has grown from a crisis to a condition. It may not be quite as permanent as say death and taxes but it's still something that could get a whole lot worse before it gets better. Until there's more realistic pricing no gubernatorial pea-under-the-shell buyout scheme will solve it. Beyond the energy crisis however and in many ways similar to it California faces a whole range of other infrastructure problems -- in transportation in water resources and sewer systems in school and university buildings -- that seem once again to be all but forgotten. The Business Roundtable has estimated the need at roughly $90 billion though no number can possibly be exact. What's certain is that after a burst of high-level investment in public facilities during the 1950s and 1960s California's annual capital investment has sunk precipitously -- from an annual $150 per capita in the 1960s according to a set of recent studies for PPIC the Public Policy Institute of California to about $30 in the 1990s. But you probably don't need to tell anyone driving Bay Area or Los Angeles freeways or looking at the ubiquitous portable classrooms those dreary brown boxes that house a fourth of our public school students. Ever since passage of Proposition 13 in 1978 we have been flying the flag of deferred maintenance. As in the state's electricity crisis however there's no way California can effectively address those problems merely by building or bonding itself out of them. In highway construction in developing water resources in finding enough university space to accommodate the Tidal Wave II of students managing demand is likely to be as crucial to any solution as new construction. In the energy market -- and in electricity particularly -- it's been a familiar principle ever since David Roe of the Environmental Defense Fund first persuaded Pacific Gas and Electric that a dollar invested in conservation may be worth as much as the same investment in new generation. But in most other sectors of California's infrastructure state and local it's a lesson still to be learned. There have been scattered attempts to encourage conservation and reduce demand -- significant reduction in water use for example through the installation of low-flow faucets and low-flush toilets some reduction in traffic by using rush-hour diamond lanes or by adjusting highway or (as in New York) bridge tolls to levels of congestion. But as pointed out by David Dowall an urban economist at Berkeley state policy-makers have not really begun to consider how demand management strategies can be applied to infrastructure service areas or how the more efficient use of facilities and more realistic pricing -- highway tolls say or parking fees -- can reduce demand for scarce infrastructure resources. In any case says Dowall in one of the PPIC reports we should pick which major projects we will build not just according to per capita estimates of how much we need but according to how much consumers are willing to pay for them. To avoid hurting the poor congestion-related highway tolls and other tariffs can be rebated on the basis of income. University fees can be means-tested. In California they also could be adjusted to encourage summer school classes and other off-peak uses rather than (as in the past) making UC summer courses more expensive. Given the political and economic uncertainties there's no way to know how far such demand management can be taken. But there's not much doubt that as Dowall and others point out the state's infrastructure planning is a jumble of uncoordinated agency agendas and wish lists. The Legislature last year passed a bill AB 1473 by Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg that requires the governor beginning next year to submit an annual five-year infrastructure plan for state agencies and public schools along with recommendations on how to fund it. In addition Gov. Gray Davis' infrastructure commission is expected to recommend better coordination of infrastructure and land-use planning when it issues its report this spring. That would be a start. As California State Treasurer Phil Angelides has pointed out the state desperately needs to start joint planning -- regional planning -- for housing roads and other resources to reduce the need for long commutes to preserve open space and to bring jobs to where people live and housing to where the jobs are. That would itself reduce demand for more freeway lanes and equally important improve the quality of life. At present most planning for housing roads water systems and other facilities rarely recognizes the regional impact of local decisions. In the East Bay slow-growth forces push well-intended initiatives that would force more development into Tracy or Modesto and further tax the transportation systems to Silicon Valley. In city after city there are beggar-thy-neighbor efforts to grab yet another shopping mall that produces a little extra sales tax revenue for the city that gets it and that often compounds traffic and revenue problems in adjacent communities. In higher education we divide bond proceeds evenly among UC the California State University and the community colleges even though the community colleges serve eight times as many students as UC. We plan road projects according to county not regional priorities. It is all done according to antiquated political and fiscal formulas that often no longer make sense. We don't just need better capital planning we need a whole new planning system. ---- PG&E power plan debated at hearing A PUC meeting on the utility's capacity expansion project for the Tri-Valley follows weeks of protest from officials residents Power upgrade in valley debated By Megan Long TIMES STAFF WRITER SAN FRANCISCO -- Dublin officials and the developer of a Livermore subdivision faced questions Tuesday about their opposition to alternative routes of PG&E's controversial Tri-Valley power upgrade plan -- and answered by restating their long-standing objections. Tuesday's cross-examination came during the third and likely final week of the California Public Utility Commission's evidentiary hearings on the utility's $91 million Tri-Valley 2002 Capacity Increase Project. It has followed weeks of protests of PG&E's upgrade plans by officials and residents of Livermore Pleasanton Dublin and San Ramon. And before the questioning started Dublin Vice Mayor Janet Lockhart reiterated concerns about an alternative route deemed environmentally superior that would place a substation just 1000 feet north of Interstate 580 between Tassajara and Fallon roads. She said that would undermine the results of a 15-year process to plan the eastern development of the city. It's extremely important to the residents of our community to follow a plan we worked hard to produce she said. Dublin officials favor PG&E's proposed placement of the station three miles north of the freeway away from new high-tech company offices and housing developments. Besides the Dublin substation the project calls for construction of a substation in North Livermore expansion of the Pleasanton substation and installation of 23.5 miles of new lines. In response to questions from PUC Administrative Law Judge Michelle Cooke Dublin's public works director Lee Thompson confirmed that the Lin family the owner of the property where the alternative substation would go wasn't interested in selling the land to PG&E. Cooke also asked Thompson to define a discretionary permit which is how city officials said they might treat a permit for a substation. Lee said that type of permit is one the city has the right to approve or not depending on the project's impact. Eddie Peabody Dublin's community development director testified that the zoning for the Lin property accommodates uses such as commercial business research and development and light manufacturing. It would not he said be appropriate for a power substation. He said parcels within the East Dublin area that could host a station would include those zoned for public and semi-public uses including land recently bought by Oracle and Sun Microsystems for new campuses. While Dublin officials testified that one buyer of land in that area paid $86 per square foot others suggested land prices would be inflated to help make a PG&E land buy look prohibitively expensive. An executive of Centex Homes the developer of new houses near Isabel Avenue and Concannon Boulevard objected to an alternative route that would place high-voltage transmission lines overhead along Isabel and Stanley Boulevard. David Barclay president of Centex's Northern California division said that the 80-foot to 150-foot towers would have a severe visual impact on residents of the Prima tract. Ed O'Neill a lawyer for the Kottinger Ranch Homeowners Association pointed out that existing distribution lines on 50-foot poles on Isabel already mar the view for residents. The Foley family has been ranching on land south of Pleasanton city limits for years said their attorney Kennedy Richardson. The utility's project would place overhead lines and a transmission station on rolling hills that the family envisions as one day being public open space with limited development Richardson said. Lawyers for Pleasanton Livermore Kottinger Ranch and Centex are scheduled to cross-examine a PG&E engineer today about the project's routing. That testimony should be the most controversial of the hearings. Judge Cooke is expected to recommend an alignment by July to the PUC which will make the final decision. ---- NEWS State OKs 'Peaker' Power Plant at SFO / Temporary generator could be sending electricity to 50000 homes by August Marshall Wilson 03/08/2001 The San Francisco Chronicle FINAL Page A.20 (Copyright 2001) State energy officials yesterday approved plans to build a temporary electrical plant at San Francisco International Airport that should generate enough juice to power 50000 homes by August. Meeting in Sacramento the Energy Commission voted 4-0 to give the green light to the gas-fired plant. It will operate during peak summer and winter demand to help the state avoid Stage 3 power alerts and rolling blackouts. Texas-based El Paso Merchant Energy Co. won approval under a new state law mandating speedy four-month reviews of so-called peaker plants. It was the only one of seven applications statewide to win approval. The other proposals were withdrawn for various reasons. The 51-megawatt plant formally called the United Golden Gate Power Project is scheduled to be built at the northwest corner of the airport near the United Airlines maintenance center. Within the next few weeks El Paso plans to apply to build a 571- megawatt $400 million plant in the same area company spokesman Jesse Frederick said. It would undergo a separate review by state energy officials. The small peaker plant approved yesterday is to generate electricity beginning around Aug. 1 for up to three years. After the end of three years the plant would be closed or converted to a cleaner-burning system. Under state law a temporary peaker plant is permitted to spew more air pollution than a permanent plant. El Paso's temporary plant is to be built next to a co-generation plant operated by United Airlines. It would use existing connections for natural gas and water supplies and tap into existing power transmission lines. Electricity generated by the plant would be pumped into the state's electrical grid Energy Commission spokesman Gary Fay said. It would also serve as a backup for San Francisco Airport in case of a blackout. No one spoke against the proposed plant at yesterday's commission meeting. The proposal however has been criticized by area residents and environmentalists worried about air pollution. Scott Buschman a professional photographer and San Bruno resident said yesterday it was unjust that state officials 100 miles away in Sacramento approved a Texas company's proposal to put a power plant on land owned by San Francisco. The fact that they approved it without considering the public's concerns foremost air quality is very disturbing he said. Fay said the plant complies with clean-air standards. Answering the criticism about the location of yesterday's deliberation he said three hearings and several workshops were held in communities near the airport. Copyright  2000 Dow Jones & Company Inc. All Rights Reserved. ---- Crossed Wires: Major Kinks Emerge In Gov. Davis's Plan To Power California --- State's Outlays for Electricity May Be Hard to Recover Without Rate Increases --- Betting on Long-Term Deals By Wall Street Journal staff reporters Rebecca Smith Mitchel Benson and John R. Emshwiller 03/08/2001 The Wall Street Journal A1 (Copyright (c) 2001 Dow Jones & Company Inc.) SACRAMENTO Calif. -- Earlier this year Gov. Gray Davis made what may be the biggest bet in the history of the nation's biggest state: that he could tame an out-of-control electricity market and avoid devastating blackouts without busting the state's budget antagonizing its consumers or derailing his own political career. His wager is still on the table but the assumptions that underlie it are looking increasingly shaky these days. The governor has already spent around $2 billion of public money buying hugely expensive wholesale power taking over the role formerly played by the state's near-bankrupt electric utilities. And California will probably be obliged to spend billions more before its electricity market stabilizes and those utilities are restored to some semblance of financial health. Under the governor's plan California aims to recoup the money it is using to buy electricity by issuing $10 billion in bonds. That way it would still have a healthy budget surplus to finance new spending on roads schools and other public services. But there's a potentially big obstacle to this plan. The state Legislature worried about racking up billions in new debt has put limits on the size of any bond offering. In broad terms the Legislature's action would allow the state to borrow only four times as much as it can recover annually from utility customers. Right now that doesn't appear to be much. Under the current rate structure essentially set in place by California's flawed 1996 electricity-deregulation plan consumers pay far less for power than the cost of acquiring it on the wholesale market. Preliminary estimates submitted by utilities last month to the California Public Utilities Commission show the state's share of the proceeds from electricity sales this year could be as little as $241 million -- not enough to support even $1 billion in bond sales under the Legislature's formula. That would leave the state on the hook for much of the money it has already paid for power -- not to mention the billions more Gov. Davis will need to spend. That in turn raises the prospect that California's economy and its credit rating both could deteriorate significantly. But state finance officials say that based on their own projections they will be able to extract enough money to support a $10 billion bond issue. Walking a careful line between fiscal prudence and political survival Mr. Davis and others in his administration are scrambling to come up with ways to get around the legislative restrictions without raising rates for consumers. If I wanted to raise rates I could solve this problem in 20 minutes Mr. Davis says. The governor says he believes that the state can obtain enough affordable power through long-term power-supply contracts to avoid the need for a big rate increase. The billions of dollars the state hopes to borrow would be used to help pay for power until electricity prices drop as they are expected to do when new power plants come online over the next few years. The Davis administration fears that what may be its only other option -- a big increase in retail electric rates -- could prompt angry consumer groups to seek new electricity laws through a statewide ballot initiative during next year's election. That's when Mr. Davis is expected to run for a second term as governor. But trying to save California without rate increases is forcing Mr. Davis to make some colossal gambles with the state's money. State officials estimate that in the next several months California will need to spend as much as $6 billion on power purchases -- equivalent to the state's entire fiscal surplus. Mr. Davis is also looking to spend several billion more to buy the transmission assets of three investor-owned utilities in order to restore two of them to credit-worthiness. He also has announced plans to spend several hundred million dollars more on conservation programs designed to reduce demand while new power plants are being built in the state. In order to limit the state's financial exposure in the meantime the governor and his aides have in some cases ignored state law. They have threatened appointed officials who have stood in the way. And they have sharply restricted the flow of information to the public. None of those steps is expected to do much to reduce state spending on power in the coming months. In a few weeks power usage is expected to begin a sharp seasonal rise as Californians switch on their air conditioners with the coming of warmer weather. By various estimates demand during peak periods this summer could outstrip supply by 10% or several thousand megawatts. That could produce more rolling blackouts like the ones that hit Northern California earlier this year. It is also likely to put strong upward pressure on wholesale electricity prices. Steven Zimmerman managing director of Standard & Poor's Corp. says Mr. Davis and his aides don't have a lot of time to put a cap on the state's financial exposure to the crisis. The credit-rating agency has put the state on credit watch for a possible downgrade which would affect the value of all of California's outstanding public debt. Moody's Investor Service Inc. is also concerned. It said in a recent report that the power crisis could soon seriously threaten the health of the state's economy. Mr. Davis a Democrat and career politician was dealt a bad hand when he took office in 1999. The deregulation plan that sparked the state's electricity crisis was enacted under his predecessor Republican Pete Wilson. But Mr. Davis was slow to react to early signs of trouble this past summer and alarms sounded by members of the state Legislature. By the time Mr. Davis finally sprang into action earlier this year a troublesome power-supply squeeze had escalated into a crisis. In a Jan. 17 declaration of emergency the governor designated the state Department of Water Resources to take the utilities' place as the daily buyer of huge quantities of electricity. His hope: that by making the state the dominant player in California's power sector he would ease electricity producers' concerns about getting paid and give the state enough clout to negotiate lower long-term power prices. Earlier this week Mr. Davis announced final or tentative agreements with 20 power suppliers to furnish the state with a total of 8900 megawatts for periods of as long as 20 years. But the supply situation remains extremely uncertain for this summer when demand probably will top 45000 megawatts. If the state can secure enough power under contract and push down demand through aggressive conservation it might be able to squeak through the summer season. If not it will be forced to keep buying huge amounts of costly power in the cash market. Under deregulation retail electric rates were frozen for several years while wholesale-power costs were free to fluctuate. When the plan was conceived wholesale prices were low and expected to go lower. However a combination of unexpected growth in power demand and a lack of new generating capacity helped produce a supply squeeze. Average wholesale prices more than tripled last year from 1999. And in January those prices were up 10-fold from a year earlier. By then California's two biggest investor-owned utilities -- the Pacific Gas & Electric unit of PG&E Corp. and the Southern California Edison subsidiary of Edison International -- faced imminent financial collapse. They had racked up billions of dollars in wholesale power bills they couldn't afford to pay. As generators began shying away from selling to the two utilities the Clinton administration forced them to sell power into the California market an order left in place during the first weeks of the Bush administration. Still northern California was hit by rolling blackouts on several days in early January. Since then the DWR which does some electricity trading as an adjunct to its main mission of managing the state's giant system of aqueducts and reservoirs has had to learn the ins and outs of power markets on the run. It hasn't been easy. David Mills trading-floor manager for the federal Bonneville Power Administration says the water agency has at times offered to pay $50 to $100 per megawatt hour more than the available market price. They agree to prices that make you wonder says Mr. Mills whose organization markets electricity from federal dams in the Pacific Northwest. You'd at least think they'd check to see what the prevailing price is before throwing out their offer. Mr. Mills says that to cut California some slack he occasionally has instructed his traders to sell at prices lower than the DWR had offered to pay. Ray Hart the water agency deputy director responsible for the power purchasing says he isn't aware of any cases in which the DWR has overpaid. He says his team has been extremely successful by all measures. Ultimately the DWR's trading acumen is far less important than the overall arithmetic of power supply and demand in California. With the price of natural gas that feeds many of the region's generating plants at near record levels and some suppliers reluctant to sell into the troubled California market wholesale electric prices remain stubbornly high and in recent days have again been rising. The Legislature has advanced the DWR about $3 billion from the state's general fund for power purchases. Under emergency legislation passed by the Legislature and signed by Mr. Davis on Feb. 1 the general fund is to be reimbursed from a planned bond sale later this year. But under terms of the emergency law the water agency would have to wrest $2.5 billion a year in revenue from retail electricity rates in order to sell the $10 billion worth of bonds sought by Mr. Davis. Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg a Southern California Democrat says the formula was created to ensure that there would be a way to repay the bonds without draining the state's coffers. We didn't want to just open our wallets he says. According to the language of the Feb. 1 law the water agency gets what's left of revenue collected from ratepayers after the utilities pay certain of their own power-supply bills and other expenses. And in their filings with the PUC last month the utilities reckoned under their worst-case scenarios that there would be only $241 million available to the DWR this year. State officials are quietly pushing the PUC to rejigger the formula so that the water department gets more money -- even though that would clash with terms of the Feb. 1 law. Robert Miyashiro deputy director of the Department of Finance says the emergency law was drafted poorly and has led people to believe the DWR only gets the leftover money. He predicts there will be cleanup legislation. At the request of the Davis administration the PUC is considering a plan to use a different revenue-sharing formula than the one in the state law. The proposed new formula was written in close consultation with Mr. Davis's Finance Department says PUC President Loretta Lynch who supports the initiative and is hoping to rush it through. The effort has drawn some opposition. Commissioner Richard Bilas at a recent PUC meeting questioned the legality of the commission attempting to change a formula set by the Legislature. PG&E is even more emphatic since the DWR's extra money could come at the utility's expense. The formula threatens to undo the very financial protections for the utilities that [the new law] attempted to provide the utility said in a recent filing with the PUC. As politicians and regulators wrestle with that issue the Davis administration has taken a step to reduce the outflow of state cash that also seems to conflict with the Feb. 1 law. It was widely assumed that the law required the DWR to buy any electricity the state needed to keep its lights on. However on many occasions the DWR has refused to buy power on the grounds that it was too expensive citing a portion of the new law that urges the agency to hold down costs. The task of covering any remaining shortfall has passed to the California Independent System Operator which manages the state's energy grid and is charged with buying power when necessary to avert shortages. However the ISO doesn't have any power-purchasing money of its own and the major parties it would normally bill are PG&E and Edison whose inability to pay their power bills was the reason the state started buying electricity in the first place. Amid criticism of its stance from generators utilities and Wall Street the DWR says it has started covering more of the utilities' electricity costs. The water agency is now buying 95% to 99% of what California needs in a given day says the agency's Mr. Hart. But increased buying only adds to the uncertainty about the eventual tab. The state's legislative analyst Elizabeth Hill recently recommended that lawmakers hold off considering more than $2 billion in state spending on items ranging from college construction to beach cleanups because of continuing questions about the financial impact of the electricity crisis. Like others Ms. Hill complains that the governor's office and state agencies haven't been forthcoming with information. Indeed the DWR refuses to say precisely how much power it is purchasing and at what prices though it has on several occasions gone back to the Legislature for more money. State officials say that data on its purchasing activities would give suppliers an advantage in continuing electricity-supply contract talks. State Controller Kathleen Connell who is running for mayor of Los Angeles in an April election recently announced plans to post state power-spending information on her department's Web site. But within 24 hours Ms. Connell suspended that plan after discussions with senior Davis administration officials. I feel very strongly that this information should be publicly released says Ms. Connell. I just don't want to do anything that would weaken the state's effectiveness in negotiating. In an effort to more tightly control events the governor obtained legislative approval to abolish the 26-member ISO board which was made up of everyone from utility executives to representatives of consumer groups. He then appointed a new five-member board. To ensure a quick transition the California attorney general threatened the old board members with fines of as much as $5000 each if they didn't immediately relinquish their positions. All did. I was offended at the heavy-handed treatment says Karen Johanson a former ISO board member. One of the first acts of the ISO's new board was to close a meeting about the electricity crisis. The former ISO board routinely held such meetings in public. ISO attorneys say the meeting was largely designed as a private briefing for new board members and that the organization is committed to keeping its deliberations as open as possible. The Wall Street Journal and other news organizations have unsuccessfully challenged the closure in Sacramento state court. Copyright  2000 Dow Jones & Company Inc.

Mime-Version: 1.0 Content-Type: text/plain charset=us-ascii Content-Disposition: inline IS TRADING AN INSIDER'S GAME? Buying selling of electricity is a growth business but some say deck is stacked against consumers By Craig D. Rose STAFF WRITER June 6 2001 While Californians decry deregulation's failure to deliver a competitive market electricity wholesalers have quietly developed a vast and rapidly growing business of buying and selling power among themselves. The deals take place on high-tech trading floors in Houston and elsewhere around the country as well as on Internet-based trading systems. Some experts say this electricity trading is a key mechanism for raising consumer power prices yet it's largely unregulated. Electricity trading is like buying stock -- when you have ability to change the stock price said Frank Wolak a Stanford University economics professor and member of the state grid operator's market surveillance group. Energy companies say the buying and selling of contracts to deliver power provides risk management allowing plant owners to presell their electricity lock in prices and avoid fluctuations. The rough and tumble of the free market they add is the most efficient means of allocating a resource like electricity. But industry critics say trading is far from a competitive market paradigm. In their view it's a means of communication -- a way for energy insiders to collude and raise prices under the guise of competition. To be sure the trading arms of major energy companies have emerged as stars in an industry where profit surges of 300 percent or 400 percent are not uncommon. The transactions shrouded in secrecy can leave ownership of a critical commodity in unknown hands. Consider the case of power generated by AES Corp.'s California plants. In 1998 AES made a bold move. Immediately after purchasing power plants that gave it control of 10 percent of the state's electric generating capacity the company sold the output from its plants for the next 20 years to Williams Cos. Williams did not sit on this treasure trove of electrons. The Tulsa Okla. company soon sold 80 percent of what it bought. It is difficult to say who owns that power now. Some might be owned by Sempra Trading a sister company of SDG&E. Or some could be owned by Enron Corp. the nation's biggest electricity trader. A spokeswoman for Williams conceded that Williams itself may have repurchased some of the electricity it sold earlier. But trading companies closely guard their positions. This much can be said with certainty: Electricity that AES sold for less than 5 cents per kilowatt-hour to Williams changed hands perhaps 10 times in the wholesale market and emerged at times in recent months with a price tag for consumers that was 300 percent higher. Williams' trading profits increased by 523 percent in the first quarter this year. Advance sales All this buying and selling creates curious confluences. In their attempt to deflect criticism over high prices generating companies such as Duke Energy -- operator of the South Bay Power Plant in Chula and others in the state -- frequently note that they sell most of their electricity far in advance. But they acknowledge less often that their trading units may also be buying power which could boost the company's electricity inventory. Duke was the fourth biggest electricity trader last year and cited its trading activity as a prime contributor to its wholesale business profits which soared 324 percent in the first quarter to $348 million. It is a company's power traders who frequently direct plant operators to increase or decrease the generation of power in response to market conditions. Energy companies have little option but to turn to trading for profits. One of the better kept secrets of electrical deregulation and its promise of competition is that there is remarkably little competition in the production side of the business. For one thing electricity is a commodity power from one company is indistinguishable from that generated by others. More important nearly all modern plants generate power from turbines built by a handful of manufacturers. The result? Modern plants owned by different companies produce power at nearly identical cost. The cost of power produced by modern plants is all within a mil (one-thousandth of a dollar) said Michael Peevey an adviser to Gov. Gray Davis and former president of Southern California Edison. So the extraction of profit in the electricity business relies much more on trading. Traders' profits rise when prices are volatile -- plunging or even better rising sharply. Little regulation But despite the obvious temptation to manipulate the market the burgeoning electricity trading business has remained largely unregulated. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission does require quarterly filings from energy traders but these often provide incomplete information or at least little that has been of concern to FERC. In fact although the trading of electricity grew more than a hundredfold from 1996 to 2000 FERC has taken no major enforcement action against a trader. After the onset of the California crisis last year FERC has acted once. That was against Williams which agreed to pay $8 million without admitting guilt to resolve an allegation that it withheld supply to pump up prices. FERC's record of enforcement in the area of power trading stands in contrast to a long list of enforcement actions within other markets taken by the Securities Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. FERC has recently added staff to its market oversight operations. But William Massey a FERC commissioner says the agency's effort is still inadequate. Electricity can be flipped stripped and chopped up Massey said. It's an extraordinarily complicated market. The sophisticated marketers and traders have simply moved past us. We're kind of horse and buggy in our approach and they're out there in rocket ships flying around ... The problem is that sophisticated traders don't necessarily produce reasonable prices. They produce profits. Before deregulation electricity trading was a low-key affair. Regulated utilities dealt power back and forth on a reciprocal basis to fill electricity shortfalls in their control areas. There was little trading for profit until the mid-1990s after federal legislation and FERC rulings opened the market. Major traders include large energy companies sister companies of California's major utilities and Wall Street firms. Market volatility In many ways the trading of power is similar to that of other commodities. But there are important differences. Because it cannot be stored and its use is so fundamental the price of electricity is the most volatile of all. When supplies are tight a single supplier can rapidly raise prices to budget-busting levels as evidenced by Duke Energy's recent admission that it charged California nearly $4000 for a megawatt-hour of power a quantity that probably sold hours earlier for one-tenth of that sum or less. Wolak the Stanford economist and state Sen. Joseph Dunn D-Garden Grove who is investigating the state power market say trading allows companies to collude under the guise of competition. Instead of wringing out lowest costs the wholesale trading market serves to raise prices they say. As I trade to you and you trade to me we communicate to each other what price we would like to get said Wolak. It's not collusive. It's just communicating price. Mark Palmer a spokesman for Enron the nation's biggest power trader said California's problem is not the result of trading. It's a result of shortages Palmer said. Underscoring its emphasis on trading Enron's new headquarters tower in downtown Houston rises from a six-story block of new trading floors including expanded space for electricity trading. Enron also pioneered trading in cyberspace and its Enron Online site claims to be the most active computer-based trading market. The Houston company argues that consumers won't fully benefit from power trading and deregulation until they have greater choice in choosing their power supplier. And the company says FERC has not done enough to open access to transmission lines which would allow traders to move power around the country. To that end Enron has lobbied hard for President Bush's plan for a national electricity grid. Palmer says the notion that the price of electricity rises each time it is traded is mistaken. The market is always looking for the real price of a commodity Palmer said. Dunn the California state senator says his investigation found a different function for trading. At a time when supply barely meets or falls short of demand he noted companies with electricity to sell have to worry only about how high to set their price. The trader is a pawn in the generator's game to drive up prices said Dunn. Trading develops a level of trust. You my alleged competitor will bid in the same patterns and I will respond not in a competitive pattern but in a complimentary pattern. The state senator said his investigation found evidence that on several days energy companies appeared to test their ability to drive prices up without being undercut by competitors. This ability to drive up prices without competitive consequence is a key test of market power the technical term for manipulation or price fixing. But Dunn also conceded that antitrust violations can be hard to prove in court. He suggested that even if the trading behavior falls short of antitrust violations it remains anti-competitive and devastating for the California economy. To Harry Trebing a utility industry expert and professor emeritus at Michigan State University wholesale electricity trading is reminiscent of what took place in the 1920s and early '30s. Back then utility companies created complex networks of holding companies that traded stock among themselves driving up prices in the process. Undoing that scheme was a focus of President Franklin Roosevelt's administration. Congress ended up barring national power companies and tightening regulation of utilities in an effort to counteract their tendency to create markets that work only for insiders. The broad goals of trading are the same Trebing said. The goal is to maximize profits through raising prices.,"Trading; Energy; California; Regulation

In the Senate: The Senate bill 78XX is with about 90% likelihood going to be voted out of the Senate tonight---without a vote having taking place in any committee. Burton announced during one of the two informational hearings that this is it despite the view of just about everyone who appeared before the committees the bill likely won't prevent Edison from going bankrupt. The key features of the bill are: Banks and QFs get paid in full. Edison shareholders would be responsible for debts owed to suppliers No direct access. There are conflicting reports about whether the Senate will take up the bill tomorrow de-linking the bonds from the DWR contracts and whether the Republicans will go along with it. In the Assembly: The Committee is hearing the Wright and Hertzberg bills as we speak with Hertzberg's the likely winner. That bill now provides for Direct Access under certain conditions (the amendments describing the conditions were faxed today). We're attempting to get the July 12 date changed to the effective date of the bill or later. The Assembly likely won't vote the Hertzberg bill out until tomorrow at the earliest. The Problem: The Assembly and Senate bills are diametrically opposed in the way each approaches the problem---in short the bills are two ships passing in the night. The Democratic leaders (Governor Hertzberg Burton) aren't talking and Burton hasn't expressed any interest in talking---to anybody. The likely outcome given the circumstances: Burton says he's done what he needs to do (i.e. passed out a fair bill) the Assembly and Senate can't agree they finish the budget time runs out they leave Friday and Edison's left twisting. That said there's still a chance that the Governor could call Burton and sit down with Burton and Hertzberg and work something out by Friday or begin talking and postpone the recess until they get it worked out. But given Burton the chance of that happening seems very slim. In short little has changed since yesterday. Best Jeff,"California Energy Crisis; Politics; Legislation

804,AG letter - privileged and confidential: request for legal advice.,The letter looks good. A couple of comments for your consideration: On page three we describe the change to the definition of Public Utility and then argue that we don't fit into it. Would it be worth explaining why that makes sense? Specifically the New Jersey restructuring law like most efforts of its kind in other markets is designed to separate the competitive from monopoly elements of the power (and gas) businesses. Economic regulation would then be restricted to the remaining monopoly elements of the business (eg distribution). The competitive market can not be solely relied upon to regulate the behavior of monopoly asset owners such as distribution utilities. Therefore regulators continue to be called upon to set pricing and other terms of service. What those regulators decide matters a great deal to those monopoly utilities and it consequently makes sense for lawmakers to be concerned about attempts by such entities to use campaign contributions to tacitly influence decision makers. The same public policies simply do not apply to that portion of the market which is competitive. The generation and sales business has a competitive structure (i.e. relatively low barriers to entry multiple competitors etc.). These components of the power and gas business can be regulated by the market with respect to rates and terms of service. They do not require economic regulation any more than grocery stores department stores appliance sellers or other retailers (who presumably are not prohibited from making contributions. Competition and markets discipline behavior and establish competitive prices and terms of service. Because regulators don't set the prices and terms of service for such sellers there is no reason to be concerned about campaign contribuitions from such organizations. Indeed the legislation and the legislative history clearly conform to this underlying policy rationale. As a former practicing lawyer I certainly understand the value of pleading in the alternative. But I question how certain of our arguments woud be perceived by the public if they ever came to light (which these documents have a habit of doing).. . I can just see the press seizing on Enron's claim of ignorance or mistake or the fact that we pled for the favorable exercise of prosecutorial discretion. I suggest that we add whatever we feel is necessary to the very solid looking intent argument not make specific reference to ignorance or mistake and not plead for the favorable esxercise of PD. If we feel we need to write about this last item perhaps we could suggest that it would be a waste of the public's resources to pursue a claim under such circumstances.,"Legal; Regulation

806,NEWS FLASH ON THIS MORNINGS SENATE HEARING,This morning all 5 FERC commissioners testified before the Senate Energy Committee on yesterday's order and on the pending Feinstein/Smith legislation to impose cost-of-service rates on wholesale power. Highlights and analysis are as follows: 1. Sen. Feinstein the chief sponsor of Senate price cap legislation called FERC's order a giant step forward and said she is very grateful for what the commission did. Senators Gordon Smith and Barbara Boxer agreed. Sen. Feinstein said that she and Sen. Smith would now recommend to Chairman Bingaman that next week's mark up of their price control bill be postponed for the time being pending how the order plays out in practice. Chairman Bingaman said he would follow their advice and cancel next week's mark up. (Responding to a question each of the five commissioners said that Congress should NOT act to pass Smith/Feinstein at least at this time -- this included Comr. Massey who has favored legislation in the absence of stronger action by the commission.) 2. However it is very important to point out that House Democrats in California and elsewhere out West have not been as supportive of FERC's order as have the Senators. House Democrats are still expected to attempt to offer a price control amendment to the supplemental appropriations bill when it comes before the House later this week. Of course the reaction of the Senate may undercut the House Democrats's argument at least at this time. Furthermore should prices go up and the FERC order is seen as not working price control advocates including Sens. Feinstein Smith and Boxer will no doubt pick up where they left off. 3. It will be very interesting to see how Senator Lieberman and Gov. Davis react to the FERC order at the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee hearing tomorrow morning. While this committee does NOT have legislative jurisdiction over the Feinstein/Smith legislation this hearing will be well covered by the news media. Sen. Lieberman is a cosponsor of the Feinstein/Smith legislation. 4. In my view the political and public pressure will now shift in large part -- at least for the time being -- from the legislative price cap proposals to the settlement conference process that the FERC order will set motion. There was a clear drum beat at the hearing from the western senators particularly Feinstein Boxer and Cantwell (WA) for refunds either out of the settlement conference or ordered by FERC. In essence they are pressing to have the price mitigation formula in the new order applied to power sales that took place prior to the issuance of the order. 5. Another sense of the poltiical flavor is that Sen. Schumer (D-NY) while expressing his continued support for deregulatioin and competition pressed FERC general counsel Kevin Madden (by this point the commissioners left for the RTO conference) about why the order applied only to the WSCC and did not apply nationwide. Madden at least tried to distinguish the New York and California markets but then said that Con Ed has filed pleadings with FERC to extend price mitigation to New York and he could not say any more about the matter. 6. Ranking Republican Frank Murkowski said he had received a letter today from four western governors -- those from Arizona North Dakota Utah and Wyoming -- saying that since FERC has acted there is no need for Congress to pursue price control legislation. There were a series of questions and comments on details and technical aspects of the orders. I will do an e-mail on these items later today. Please advise if you have any questions or comments.,"Energy; FERC; Senate; Legislation; Politics

809,Re: ELECTRICITY TRADED VOLUMES since 1994,I think he was looking to make a sector-wide point. For example how much of the total market moved to wholesale traded volumes? He wants to make the point that even a nontraded commodity - ie electricity in 1994 - can rapidly progress to a traded market - as electricity did between 94 and 00.

826,Comments of Wolak,Wolak makes some good points. In ERCOT Enron is in support of nodal pricing. I would not go so far as to say we are pushing for PJM's implementation however but for a market with nodal prices (and unilateral bids - aka unbalanced schedules congestion reflect by price differentials etc). I was unaware PJM had such great power to alter bids. This is something we don't want and something for which I am not aware we have advocated. Perhaps in Enron's promotion of locational prices it has been retold as PJM-style locational prices. Given that PJM is the most commonly cited example of locational prices it does not surprise me to have the sloppiness in discussions that could lead to the rumors.

Elimination of mandated buy-sell requirement for the IOUs (although no= =20 explanation as to whether this requires CPUC action). Over-reliance on spo= t=20 markets has been problematical. 4.? As an independent exchange the PX will be free to design the products= =20 desired by the market. 5.? The proposed price modification measure will be a temporary measure.= =20 Single price for all offers below $150. However no bid above $150 will se= t=20 the price for all generators. A seller can bid anything it wants. Allowing = =20 generators to receive their as-bid price will allow high-cost generators to= =20 participate in the market. However the generator will be required to=20 provide confidential reports to FERC explaining the necessity for bids ove= r=20 $150 through 12/31/02. 6.? The order requires forward scheduling of 95% of an scheduling =20 coordinator=01s schedule with a penalty applied for deviations which exce= ed 5%=20 As an incentive the proceeds of the penalties go to the schedulers who=20 comply with the tolerance band. 7.? Rejects the purchase price caps proposed by the ISO. The order would= =20 eliminate the ISO=01s price cap authority. 8.? Beginning 1/1/01 the prospect of refunds will be available. =20 ? Commissioner Hebert ? Due to a technical problem when I called in I heard only part of his =20 remarks. He announced that he will have a separate concurrence in the order= =20 but is troubled by some of its features. The $150 cap is questionable=20 whether described as a Soft cap or as a hard cap. His concern is that it will clearly discourage new investment in generatio= n.=20 He therefore recommended that the $150 cap should be escalated on a regula= r=20 basis (perhaps every six months) until it reaches at least $250.=20 ? He points out that the ISO and PX are required to make RTO filings to FERC = =20 on 1/16/01. These filings should address the major aspects of the Order=20 issued today.=20 ? Hebert also questioned the issue of refunds alleging that it was =20 disingenuous to suggests that refunds were a possible remedy.=20 ? Commissioner Breathitt=20 ? Breathitt announced almost all of the foregoing major points of the orderT= he=20 order is based on a market approach. In choosing our market-based approac= h=20 it is our goal to guide the markets to self-correct and not re-institute= =20 command and control regulation.? We have all worked too hard too long t= o=20 have this result. ? Commissioner Massey ? Sixty-five years ago the Congress decreed that prices had to be just and = =20 reasonable.? There is no exception for market-based approaches. He will =20 concur as the order does find that prices have been unjust and=20 unreasonable. The order does insure that prices should return to being jus= t=20 and reasonable. Cited Frank Wolak as proposing there ought to be an 18-24= =20 month forward product designed which the CPUC will years ago federal law= =20 dictated that prices had to be just and reasonable. The $150 is a soft cap and allows a generator to bid above it but if it= =20 does it will not set the price which other generators receive. He invites = =20 comments on this issue.=20 With regard to retroactive refunds the Office of the General Counsel has= =20 prepared a legal memorandum which concludes that the FERC probably does not= =20 have authority to order refunds retroactively for any date before October 2=  =20 2000.

California must do its part to ensure that customers= =20 do in fact benefit from competitive markets that ensure just and=20 reasonable prices.=20 He is not yet confident that the Commission has taken all necessary steps.= =20 ?

834,ATTORNEY/CLIENT COMMUNICATION//////CONFIDENTIAL and Privileged,Article II of the NONCOMPETITION AGREEMENT entered in connection with the sale of HPL to AEP (which closed as of June 12001) provides: ENA [for 3 months post-close] will not solicit negotiate or enter into any contract agreement or arrangement for the purchase of natural gas on the HPL Pipeline from any Person which is a supplier or producer of natural gas connected to the HPL Facilities provided however nothing herein shall be construed or interpreted as prohibiting ENA from entering into any such contract agreement or arrangement which is less than one month in duration and involves or is related to an Enron Online transaction. This is not the most clearly drafted provision as it was the subject of much negotiation....and was significantly narrowed from the original scope proposed by AEP. Thus please consult with me prior to entering into any solicitation agreement or arrangement which might arguably be covered by our limited covenant not to compete on the supply side for 3 months. There are many aspects of the post-close transition which will require cooperation between Enron and AEP/HPL and thus it behoves us to carefully weigh the risks and rewards of stepping too close to or over the line. Furtheralthough a technical reading of the non-competition agreement only applies to ENA no ENA UPSTREAM deals which would violate this covenant if there were to be done as ENA should be done without clearance from Brian Redmond and me. Please communicate this restriction to those who report to you and have need to be aware of this limited restriction.

839,Confidential - Decision tree on projects,Something for us to talk about during our next staff meeting. There are three projects which have significant cash flow problems and thus= difficulties in meeting debt obligations: these are: SECLP Panama and Gaz= a. In the past as I suppose we have done in Dabhol we have taken the pos= ition that we would not inject cash into these companies and would be prepa= red to face a default and possible acceleration of the loans. SECLP has be= en the biggest issue/problem. Panama is much less (a few million of floati= ng of our receivables from the company) would be sufficient to meet the cas= h crunch in April of this year. Note that in Panama the debt is fully gu= aranteed by the government and is non-recoursed to the operating company B= LM. In the past we have discussed letting the debt default which would c= ause the bank to potentially seek complete payment and acceleration from th= e GoPanama. The reason: the vast majority of BLM's problems stem from acti= ons taken by the regulator that have effectively amended our PPA's with pri= vate parties those actions resulted in significant loss of revenues which= although today have stopped or have been limited have left a mark on th= e company's liquidity position. =20 Now the question is: come April of 2002 should any of our actions in Panam= a or decisions related thereto (which we would have otherwise taken or made= ) be affected in any way by either the proposed merger or an effort by Enro= n to preserve efforts to re-establish investor/creditor confidence? The sa= me could go for SECLP and Gaza. This is simply an overall guidance question. Let's take it up during our= staff meeting next week if that's ok with you.

853,,FYI. From today's Post. Davis seems to continue to put distance between himself and the contracts. Best Jeff Financial California Changes Stance on Refunds Two Sides Far Apart In Energy Talks Peter Behr ? 07/06/2001 The Washington Post FINAL Page E01 Copyright 2001 The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved California officials have abruptly shifted tactics in their attempt to recover billions of dollars in alleged overcharges for electricity  saying they may reduce their demands for huge refunds if generators renegotiate $43 billion in long-term electricity contracts that the state signed this year. Gov. Gray Davis (D) said part of the $8.9 billion in refunds the state is seeking could be offset by reductions in energy prices in the long-term contracts whose costs have become a growing political embarrassment for Davis. We've made suggestions we've offered various ways in which people could get us $8.9 billion Davis told the San Jose Mercury News in a report yesterday. You can renegotiate our existing contracts and save us money. However you want to do it it's just got to net out close to $8.9 billion. The new offer was introduced this week into the closed negotiations over a California settlement being conducted in Washington by Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Judge Curtis L. Wagner Jr. according to sources close to the negotiations. Yesterday Wagner said he may issue his own preliminary finding today on the amount of overcharges if California officials and the generators cannot reach a compromise. What I'm trying to do is get people in a settlement mood Wagner told reporters. In the event we're unable to do that [Friday] at some point I may offer a preliminary assessment. The settlement conference is set to conclude on Monday. Wagner FERC's chief administrative judge has been trying to push both sides toward a compromise that would resolve the huge energy pricing controversy. Mountainous energy prices have bankrupted California 's largest utility drained billions of dollars out of the state treasury and put Davis at sword's point with generators that help keep the state's lights on. Last Friday Wagner rebuked Davis's chief representative Michael Kahn chairman of California Independent Grid Operator -- the state's power grid manager -- indicating that the state's demand for nearly $9 billion in refunds from power generators and marketers was too high sources said. Wagner's settlement conference which has involved more than 100 lawyers for all sides is closed to the public and media. Wagner complained last month that Kahn was following a political agenda and his lack of independence in the negotiations was such a joke that the parties might as well wear clown suits according to a Dow Jones report confirmed by sources close to the talks. But he has also criticized the generators and power marketers led by Reliant Energy Inc. Williams Energy Services Duke Energy and Southern Co. for failing to make serious settlement offers these sources said. The suppliers have offered to refund $600 million provided the state is able to call off various California lawsuits demanding far larger refunds sources said. Wagner's leverage is his ability to propose his own refund figure to FERC's commissioners. FERC has tentatively called for $124 million in refunds but now is taking a harder line on preventing a new escalation of California 's electricity prices this summer and is likely to be receptive to a higher refund figure some energy analysts believe. Davis's tactical change offering to make the long-term contracts part of an overall settlement comes amid growing criticism of what the state will have to pay for energy under those deals. California 's energy calamity stemmed in large part from its failed deregulation plan which relied heavily on short-term power purchases at volatile spot market prices. When energy costs shot upward last summer so did the state's electricity bills. In response Davis's aide S. David Freeman and his staff began negotiating long-term power contacts with suppliers. The $43 billion in deals signed so far would require the state to pay about $70 per hour for a megawatt of power for a large part of the electricity it will need over the next 10 years. That's well under the average of $250 per megawatt-hour that the state was paying at the beginning of this year but above current power prices -- and considerably higher than what electricity may cost in the next decade energy analysts say. A new agreement to lower those contract prices could relieve political pressure on Davis and focus settlement negotiations away from the state's controversial demand for the $8.9 billion refund. Davis will argue that reducing future power charges that his administration negotiated should count as a refund because the deals were reached under commercial duress according to sources close to Wagner's negotiations. Industry supporters say Davis's refund figure is impossible to justify. There's no benchmark for what a fair and reasonable price should be said Michael Zenger California director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates. The state's advocates counter that if FERC enforced a just and reasonable standard for power prices based on operating costs and a generous profit the overcharges by all sellers could easily reach the $9 billion figure. It's not rocket science but it does require the regulators to regulate said Frank Wolak a Stanford University economist who heads an oversight committee for the California grid. Those polar-opposite views have left both sides in Wagner's conference room billions of dollars apart as the talks approached their final weekend sources said.,"Energy; California; Politics; Refunds; Negotiations

871,Bingaman Draft On Transparency -- Amendment Ideas,Last night Linda and I spent a fairly long time with Leon Lowery Chairman Bingaman's chief electricity advisor to discuss our concerns with the transparency and market-based rate language -- while at the same time commending the transmission access language in the draft and strategizing how to support the chairman in that regard. We made progress on transparency less so on market-based rates. On transparency Leon understands our concerns. In a nutshell he seemed amenable to amending the langauge to avoid the result of having to divulge transaction-specific trade-specific information. We persuaded Leon that was the impact of the initial language although he initially said details would be left to FERC. We persuaded him that if any data is to be provided it MUST be only in aggregate form. We also impressed on him that if as he said the intent is to leave details to FERC -- then more of the details should be left to FERC not set by statute. Leon strongly advised that we seek to craft language consistent with the above exchange that makes as few changes to the draft as needed to make the necessary corrections. This will make it easier for Leon to navigate the internal waters of the staff. (Sam Fowler th chief counsel is a drafting stickler). Others should obviously weigh in and review this but to facilitate internal comments (we need to get back to Leon today) here is my take on what he has in mind. Under new sec. 218(b) (to be added to the FPA by bill sec. 413) (pg. 13) under information required we would rewrite paragraph 2 as follows: (2) each broker exchange or other market-making entity that matches offers to sell and offers to buy wholesale electric energy in interstate commerce to provide aggregate statistical information about its sales of electric energy at wholesale in interstate commerce. The effect of the language change is drop the reference to sale prices of each sale of electric energy. By leaving it as aggregate statistical information this should give FERC maximum flexibility to permit indexes etc. As to the timely basis of information release (subsection (c)) the alternatives sent yesterday would require this to be done on the Internet after the end of the trading day. If we can restrict this to aggregate data question arises whether we want to concede that this would be done daily. That suggests the data to be collected would be more than we would want I think. Here is a take on how we might suggest a revision to that language to give FERC more leeway: (c) TIMELY BASIS -- The Commission shall require the information required under subsection (b) to be posted on the Internet and updated as frequently as practicable and appropriate. The change is to add appropriate so that FERC can consider other than whether posting is practicable. The use of appropriate is what came to mind -- perhaps there is some other word or phrase like consistent with ... or promote competition or some way of saying there are policy considerations other than practicability. There should be some valid purpose established before data is released. I would argue that the (d) language on commercially sensitive information goes only to exempting from disclosure not when disclosure is appropriate. Please let me have your thoughts although the tragedy in NYC and DC now underway will probably make this not a day to transact such business on the Hill. Will provide a further report on market-based rates. In sum Leon was not as sympathetic on this issue but asked for our ideas and further arguments. We sense Leon personally feels strongly about moving the FPA to some linkage to competitive markets. His argument is that market participants can be doing everything by the book and the result can still be uncompetitive markets. We pushed that penalizing us is not the answer -- nor is increasing regulatory uncertainty about deals doing to help keep prices down. Leon clearly does not intend this language to punish Enron -- but others who we might all agree have done things that are not in keeping with competitive markets.,"Energy; Legislation; Transparency; FERC

872,Re: 2001 budget,I do support the change. Let me know what I can do to help. You are correct: this is the way we handle regulatory counsel in other regions particularly the US. What Derrick and I have agreed with regard to counsel selection is: gov't/reg affairs picks the counsel we want to use and he retains a veto which has rarely if ever been exercised. Once we have retained counsel we will use that counsel on other regulatory projects unless the legal department starts to have a problem with the firm (eg because they represent someone against us in litigation). Again I don't recall this ever being an issue. It seems to work: outside counsel gets the message that we will look dimly on any firm that squares off against us and we select the most qualified counsel on our issues.

MOST IMPORTANTLY you will see that I am budgetting to pay a substantial sum for legal fees. I will be proposing to John Sherriff Michael Brown (our new COO and former General Counsel which will make my proposal doubly problematic) and to Mark Evans (current General Counsel) that I pay/manage our outside regulatory counsel. We can discuss (rather than do a lengthy e-mail) but having this function managed by Legal (and Houston/Jim Derrick rejecting our choice of counsel in important cases) is increasingly a problem.

874,california energy prices,Summary of what we discussed the other night: Background: power -- power prices have moved above $1000/mwh in the Northwest and are showing $600-700 for the first quarter of 01 forward prices in California have also moved well above the soft cap of $150. Sellers are exporting power from California to the Northwest. gas -- balance of the month gas in California was trading at $26-27 with Jan trading at $19 feb at $12-14 and Summer at $8. The Cal gas and power utilities remain unhedged (price caps are in place for retail power and utilities continue to buy power from the ISO and PX while gas utilities we believe are primarily buying at spot prices even under their long term deals). The power utilities will continue to book large deferrals and gas utilities will be passing costs through a month or two after incurring them. The impact of the gas price increases will begin showing up in Jan billings to consumers. curtailment rules (gas): More work to be done here but it appears that gas utilities will curtail deliveries in the following order: interruptible first (with some priority for cogens) firm service (with utilities alternating or rolling between generation load and nongeneration load) and core customers last. Curtailment rules apparently allow the utilities to confiscate gas sold to direct access customers,"Energy; Prices; California; Gas; Utilities

882,Re: India Help,Thanks so much for your message. Your communications are always complete firm clear and polite. I am sorry that perhaps the most critical aspect of your efforts -- security-- has been so confused by our end. I understand from John Brindle that the confusion generated by our end has not kept you from accomplishing a great deal of the work anyway. I have asked John to lead the effort to the extent you need him. John and his team are very experienced and have been in contact with and coordination with the London office. Mike Hicks is a good hand but for the most part all I have asked him to do is be in a position to identify outside resources skilled in the area in question. It is a bit too much to ask Mike to be hands on for all of Enron's corporate security needs. A little background I'll bore you with: after Andre Legallo (formerly VP of Security for Enron) left we did not replace his function. Most of the operating companies had their own security and business controls groups. When Andre left we reduced the corporate function to a default provider role -- if a business unit had a need it was not otherwise meeting Mike Hicks (as well as an outside consulting firm) would help identify competent resources in the area. With the reorganization of EBS I have inherited the very competent and experienced team they had assembled (led by John Brindle). John identified some concerns regarding India mid last week. I urged him to get in touch with Rebecca he did. It was clear after further inquiries by John that the India team had already addressed many if not all of the concerns and much of the remaining work involved implementation. John volunteered to send some people over to help and I said OK. He had already been in touch with the London team and Mike Hicks (who I have asked to return to Houston). The last thing you need right now is confusion caused by a group saying we're from corporate and we're here to help. If you don't need any help or if the situation gets anything other than significantly better let me know. To: Steven J Kean/NA/Enron@Enron cc: Rebecca McDonald/Enron@EnronXGate James A Hughes/Enron@EnronXGate Subject: India Help Steve As you are well aware we are facing a lot of things happening fast in India. We are using several parts of your team and are very pleased with most. I want to mention a couple of areas HR and Security. 1. HR: I heard that some folks in Houston had raised concerns about the quality of the India HR team and their preparedness. The HR team is doing an outstanding job and I wanted you to hear that from me. Once we realized we had a major issue on our hand and I received clearance from Rebecca and Jim to bring some HR folks into the loop HR had someone on a plane within 20 hours of my first call. We have always had great HR support through Drew Lynch and Bob Sparger helping our team led by Sandip Malik and this time Scott Gilchrist has joined in and helped as well. But the two workhorses have been Bob and Sandip. Bob got on a plane immediately and came over and he and Sandip have been working around the clock so that we are much better prepared now than we were just a couple of days back. We really relied heavily on HR and Drew had his team there for us. 2. PR: top notch team of John Ambler and Johan Zaayman working with and supporting Jimmy Mogal on the ground. Johan and Jimmy have been a strong team on the ground and John has provided leadership and all coordination with Houston. Great efforts and productive work. 3. Security: This area has not worked as well and if you ever want feedback on our one-time experience with this group I will provide it. I don't have any idea who is in charge from Enron's perspective here. There are 2 groups headed this way. Mike Hicks will arrive Thursday night and Mike has informed us that he will be leading all security efforts. Jim Rountree is apparently travelling with Mike and Don Hawkins sent me an e-mail earlier today telling me that Don has instructed Jim that Jim is in charge of coordinating our security. John Brindle has sent me an e-mail saying that you have asked him to coordinate and help in the ongoing efforts and John is sending 3 people over arriving Saturday night. First we are very happy to have the help but I just hope that Mike Jim and John know which of the three are in charge. If you could just let me know who you want to be in charge we will coordinate with that person. On a side note the people who have really been helpful were brought in through Drew Lynch of Europe HR. They are Jim Roth and Dave Lawler both of whom work for John Sherriff. They had a great attitude were willing to work day and night and were planning on coming to coordinate until Mike decided he would come. At Mike's earlier suggestion we engaged Hill & Associates to help on security. Because I was having to meet with them 3 to 4 times per day I asked Jane Wilson to help coordinate all our security efforts. Jane has done a fantastic job in an impossibly short time frame. The tasks she has been overseeing include coordinating with Hill & Associates removing (in a lowkey yet rush manner) over 400 boxes of files and documents and getting them through customs and to Europe removing 2 container truck loads of files from the Dabhol site and getting them out of the country and overseeing a complete security check and file removal of all our electronic files from servers desktops and laptops. In addition she has coordinated security for all expats and families as well as worked with EOGIL expats and Anthony Duenner of EBS Asia. Again we appreciate all the help.

883,Re: Weekly Notes,We are discontinuing the executive car wash. You Steve and I should talk. From: Bill Donovan@ECT on 05/17/2001 03:29 PM To: Steven J Kean/NA/Enron@Enron Maureen McVicker/NA/Enron@Enron cc: Subject: Weekly Notes Steve - I will be taking this Friday the 18th off on vacation. Here are notes for your staff meeting. Buyer/Seller have executed Offer Letter on Falcon EX ($32750000 price). Aircraft goes to pre-purchase inspection this weekend. Close is no later than June 6th. All indications are that buyer is very motivated to complete the deal. Enron Center South (ECS) Project remains solidly on track. We are 10 weeks out on initial occupancy with Level 3 occupancy (EGM moves Aug. 3rd). Levels 4 (EIM ENW & Credit.Com) occupies two weeks later (Aug. 17). Level 5 (Power) occupies two weeks after (Aug. 31st - Labor Day weekend). Level 6 (Gas) occupies two weeks after (Sept. 14th). Level 7 (Executive) and the 1st floor public spaces occupies year end. Level 2 (Cafeteria) opens Nov. Found a Law firm interested in Azurix's present space in Three Allen Center (3 floors). Goal is cut deal and have them in by year end. Enron Broadband indicates an intent to remain on their present ECN floors (Levels 44 and 45) plus backfill balance of operations into Wholesale's vacated trading floors. This splits them into two elevator banks and becomes problematic for ETS - who wants continuous floors ECN Levels 39 through 46. We are seeking subtenants for Broadband's Portland office space. They plan to vacate the Riverplace building by Oct. Negotiating new food service contract with Sedexo Marriott to add ECS cafeteria. Total compensation will be based on 3% fee on gross revenue - only on individual sales of $2 or more (promote greater # of meals served) and bonus based on sharing of net operating income with Enron. Global Sourcing is participating with us in negotiations. Need to decide if Executive Car Care program is going to be continued (30 executives participate with employee paying $70 per month and business units subsidizing $275 per month). Decision needed because new Garage will require $60K in improvements to get set up for car washing. Present lease on remote car washing facility (@ $5k per month) expired and we are on month to month holdover. We are two weeks out to close on Beltway 8 land deal ($1.7 purchase price). Real estate being acquired for construction of new $18 mill. Data Center and Disaster Recovery Facility.

It seems to me that even though we are having our share of problems we have probably had fewer problems than the government did and have probably been more responsive and thorough in our clean up efforts. Obviously we would need to be judicious about how we used such information (we don't want to aggravate the government) but having such an analysis may be helpful in showing the progress made and in discouraging overly punitive action by the government.

889,Security question,Dear guys Having been out of the office for a couple of days I've found myself the victim of theft (again). This time my desk drawer key has been stolen from its hiding place under my telephone. I *always* lock my drawers and keep the key in the same place but on arriving in the office today I found the drawers unlocked and the key missing. Although there's nothing sensitive on or around my desk I'm concerned about the security implications of someone sniffing around the office in this manner. I also found the papers on my desk extensively reshuffled last week. Last year in our old office I had my only two real options books stolen from among the many and varied books on my desk. That couldn't have been a random theft and I fear this isn't either. I can't understand who'd be so interested in a Research guy's belongings! Can we ask security to check their surveillance footage for any suspicious activity around my desk? Cheers Steve,"Security; Theft

San Jose Mercury News April 19 2001 Thursday KR-ACC-NO: SJ-POWER LENGTH: 593 words HEADLINE: Testimony Indicates California Electricity Market Was Troubled in 1998 BYLINE: By Brandon Bailey BODY: ??SACRAMENTO Calif.--California's electricity market was showing signs of trouble as far back as 1998 the year that it was officially opened to competition members of a special legislative investigating committee were told Wednesday. ??Abnormal price spikes -- far higher than what should have occurred in a competitive market -- were showing up in August 1998 the committee was told by Frank Wolak a Stanford economist and top advisor to the California Independent System Operator which runs the state's transmission grid. ??Appearing on the first day of hearings called by a state Senate select committee to investigate alleged wholesale energy price manipulation Wolak testified that the ISO's economic advisors repeatedly found signs that power suppliers were able to influence prices over the last three years -- even before wholesale prices soared skyhigh last summer. ??By controlling even a relatively small portion of power supply just enough to make a difference in whether the state could meet consumers' needs Wolak said generators have been able to charge prices far higher than their costs. ??All told the ISO has estimated power suppliers collected more than $ 6 billion in unjustified profits last year. ??In his opinion Wolak added that violates the terms by which federal regulators allowed the suppliers to enter the state's newly deregulated market when it opened in 1998. ??The ISO is now filing petitions with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission asking that agency to revoke the generators' right to charge unregulated prices. ??But Wolak repeatedly told the committee that he had no evidence that the suppliers acted in collusion or that they had violated any federal anti-trust laws. ??When state Senator Joe Dunn D-Garden Grove pressed him on the point Wolak insisted I can't say yes I can't say no. There's a lot of things that certainly look puzzling. It's hard without further information and analysis to say definitively but there's lots of things to seem to be worth looking into. ??Dunn a former consumer attorney is leading the Legislature's efforts to answer a question that a host of other state and federal officials have also posed: have California's electricity prices been the result of any illegal or unethical acts? ??Power suppliers and their representatives have repeatedly said the answer is no. They say their prices are the result of short supplies and natural market swings. ??Eleven investigations into California's electricity market have been conducted or are currently under way said a statement issued Wednesday by Jan Smutny-Jones executive director of the Independent Energy Producers Association. Not one has found or proven any wrongdoing by generators. ??Dunn however said Wednesday's testimony was only the start of what he promised would be a vigorous investigation. He said the committee has already asked several power companies for records and other information and he hinted that subpoenas may be issued in the coming weeks. ??We will try to figure out how to stop these high prices if they are unjustified Dunn said at the beginning of the hearing. ??We're not going to be looking for ways to finance these payments he added. The state is now paying $ 70 million a day to buy power for California consumers after major utilities wracked up billions in debts while buying power on the open market in recent months. ??----- ??To see more of the San Jose Mercury News or to subscribe to the newspaper go to http://www.sjmercury.com JOURNAL-CODE: SJ LOAD-DATE: April 19 2001 of 5 DOCUMENTS ???????????????????The Associated Press State & Local Wire The materials in the AP file were compiled by The Associated Press. ?These materials may not be republished without the express written consent of The Associated Press. ??????????????????????April 19 2001 Thursday BC cycle AM Eastern Time SECTION: State and Regional LENGTH: 930 words HEADLINE: Developments in California's energy crisis BYLINE: By The Associated Press BODY: ??Developments in California's energy crisis: ??THURSDAY: ??- The state remains free of power alerts as reserves stay above 7 percent. ??- Gov.

Independent Energy Producers Executive Director Jan Smutny-Jones says the generators can't afford to operate because they are still owed more than a billion dollars and because the PUC's rates don't cover their operating costs. ??PUC President Loretta Lynch also wants the commission to decide Thursday to investigate whether PG&E's April 6 bankruptcy protection filing is enough of a threat to the PUC's regulatory authority to prompt more PUC involvement in the bankruptcy proceedings. ??THE PROBLEM: ??High demand high wholesale energy costs transmission glitches and a tight supply worsened by scarce hydroelectric power in the Northwest and maintenance at aging California power plants are all factors in California's electricity crisis. ??Edison and PG&E say they've lost nearly $14 billion since June to high wholesale prices that the state's electricity deregulation law bars them from passing on to consumers. PG&E saying it hasn't received the help it needs from regulators or state lawmakers filed for federal bankruptcy protection April 6. ??Electricity and natural gas suppliers scared off by the two companies' poor credit ratings are refusing to sell to them leading the state in January to start buying power for the utilities' nearly 9 million residential and business customers. The state is also buying power for a third investor-owned utility San Diego Gas & Electric which is in better financial shape than much larger Edison and PG&E but also struggling with high wholesale power costs. ??The Public Utilities Commission has raised rates up to 46 percent to help finance the state's multibillion-dollar power-buying.

LOAD-DATE: April 19 2001 Power bloc blasts seizure idea Producers say talk of bold action fuels crisis By Steve Geissinger SACRAMENTO BUREAU ?-- Oakland Tribune SACRAMENTO -- Outraged by a report in The Oakland Tribune that some lawmakers asked the governor to seize high-priced power contracts a key industry group Tuesday warned the Davis administration and Legislature that such action would worsen the energy crisis. We're publicly saying . . . this kind of rhetoric will have dire consequences on both the reliability and cost of power in California for years to come said Jan Smutny-Jones executive director of the Independent Energy Producers Association. It is the kind of rhetoric one would expect in Indonesia or the Philippines not the sixth largest economy on the planet he said in a teleconference. At the same time Davis administration officials confirmed that seizing contracts of allegedly profiteering brokers is the most likely last-ditch move if options continue to narrow ahead of the previously discussed concepts of seizing California power plants owned by out-of-state firms or passing a windfall profits tax. Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio pointed out the governor already seized power contracts on which California's investor-owned utilities were defaulting in early February. The state trying to buy its way out of the energy crisis with no clear end in sight lost a substantial measure of control over electricity prices and supplies to the courts with the recent bankruptcy filing by the Pacific Gas and Electric Co. Gov. Gray Davis a Democrat employed hard-sell tactics Tuesday in an effort to convince reluctant Democrats that their failure to embrace his plan to financially rescue teetering Southern California Edison could plunge that utility into bankruptcy as well. While most Republicans are flatly opposed to the plan as misguided Democrats who hold a majority in the Legislature worry it's a public bailout of an investor-owned utility and would hand the state control over only Edison's south-state piece of the strategic high-voltage transmission grid in California. Soaring wholesale power costs have financially shattered utilities forcing the state into runaway multibillion-dollar spending that helps keep the lights on but threatens the state budget. The manager of the state's power grid has accused generators and marketers of overcharging Californians more than $6 billion in recent months. Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg D-Van Nuys said Monday that members of both legislative houses were interested in seizure of California power plants' contracts with brokers who sell to customers within or outside the state. Sen. Don Perata D-Oakland an outspoken critic of the Davis administration's handling of the crisis said some lawmakers had asked the governor to use emergency or eminent domain powers to seize the overpriced contracts and were awaiting Davis' answer this week. Supporters of the move said seizure would allow the state to control where the power is sold and decrease price markups by eliminating the middleman. But myriad questions remain unanswered including regulatory and interstate commerce issues as well as any state reimbursement of the brokers. Any move to seize power contracts would be overturned by the courts said Gary Ackerman executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum. Instead of trying to do what's legally within their reach they go to extreme measures that are on their very face unlawful and unconstitutional Ackerman said. Moreover industry officials said seizure would not only chill industry investment in California's power system and lead to higher power costs but would be ironic since California has shunned lower-cost long-term contracts industry officials said. It would create a very unstable political regulatory environment Smutny-Jones said. It would have extremely adverse consequences for California in the long term. Even so the talk has worried the industry. Smutny-Jones said his clients are very very troubled by this sudden turn in rhetoric. I assume when senior members of the Legislature make pronouncements about potentially seizing contracts it's designed to get our attention and we obviously take those things seriously he said. The Independent Energy Producers group is in the process of contacting the Davis administration and lawmakers said Smutny-Jones. You'll hear more about this. Copyright 2001 Copley News Service Copley News Service April 19 2001 Thursday SECTION: State and regional LENGTH: 780 words HEADLINE: Windfall-profits tax gets Davis' backing BYLINE: Bill Ainsworth DATELINE: SACRAMENTO BODY: ??Federal regulators' failure to stop what they described as anti-competitive practices in the natural-gas industry added $750 million to Southern California Edison's cost of electricity a consultant estimated yesterday. ??The consultant Paul Carpenter of the Brattle Group spoke to an Assembly subcommittee investigating why California pays the highest natural-gas prices in the nation. Natural gas is a critical part of the electricity crisis because most of the state's generating plants run on natural gas. ??Natural-gas prices have soared throughout the nation but the bench mark price paid at California's border has been double that paid at other bench mark locations throughout the nation for months according to figures released by the Assembly Subcommittee on Energy Oversight. ??Next week Carpenter plans to testify at hearings in Washington D.C. on behalf of Southern California Edison and the California Public Utilities Commission which are asking federal regulators to intervene. ??The giant utility and the state regulatory body contend that a sweetheart deal between El Paso Natural Gas and El Paso Merchant Energy gave the sister companies enough market power to artificially raise the price of natural gas that flows into Southern California from Texas. ??El Paso owns the major pipeline bringing natural gas from fields in New Mexico and Texas to Southern California. El Paso Merchant Energy is an unregulated sister company. ??Carpenter called the prices paid in Southern California ''simply unprecedented'' in the United States. He estimated that the sister companies manipulated the market enough to add $2.60 to the price of a million British thermal units of gas. ??In addition he said El Paso Merchant Energy owns part of 20 smaller power plants ''qualifying facilities'' that get paid based on the price of natural gas in California. The higher natural-gas prices increase the company's revenues Carpenter said. ??El Paso company officials are expected to testify in front of the Assembly subcommittee today but in proceedings before the federal regulators they have denied any sweetheart deal. ??In a report they commissioned the company blamed the higher natural-gas prices in Southern California on increased demand and constraints on pipeline capacity. ??Gov. Gray Davis meanwhile gave his strongest endorsement yet to a windfall-profits tax on generators as a Senate committee chaired by Joseph Dunn D-Laguna Niguel began a series of hearings to probe possible price gouging by generators. ??''I believe the Legislature would be well within its prerogative to insist that generators receive an appropriate reduction whether it's 20 percent or any other number the Legislature hit upon'' Davis said. ??Senate Democrats Davis said will form a special committee to help work on his plan for the state purchase of the transmission system of Southern California Edison for $2.76 billion in exchange for state aid in paying off the utilities' debt. ??The governor said he told Senate Democrats a number of whom are skeptical of the plan that Edison's parent firm has agreed to back a $3 billion upgrade of the neighborhood distribution system retained by Edison and to return a $400 million tax refund to the utility. ??At the natural-gas hearing yesterday state officials said that after El Paso Merchant Energy bought a significant part of the pipeline capacity from its sister company it withheld natural gas to drive prices up. ??''Marketers have gamed the system and figured out how to hoard capacity and undermine competition'' said Harvey Morris an attorney for the California Public Utilities Commission. ??State regulators want the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission which regulates natural gas to open the market to more competitors. ??But the commission has repeatedly rejected similar complaints in the past. On March 28 FERC ruled that the affiliates did not arrange a sweetheart deal. ??''The fact that El Paso Merchant controls a large volume of capacity does not in and of itself render the El Paso contracts unjust unreasonable or unduly discriminatory'' FERC ruled. ??In other cases involving natural gas federal regulators acknowledged that certain contract provisions allowed anti-competitive behavior but they approved those contracts anyway. ??Lawmakers said they were puzzled by the federal regulators' lack of action. ??''It baffles me that we've found the problem anti-competitive behavior and market gaming but there's no cure because federal regulators won't take action'' said Assemblyman Juan Vargas D-San Diego.

Not going to happen Vice President Dick Cheney insists. Don't waste your energy thinking about it. ??Frankly California is looked on by many folks as a classic example of the kinds of problems that arise when you do use price caps Cheney said in a telephone interview Wednesday. ??The vice president was referring to another type of price cap--the infamous state cap on consumer rates that has left the private utilities billions short of enough revenue to pay their gouging wholesalers. What political leaders in California and the Northwest are pleading for from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is a regional cap on wholesale prices. ??Early last year a megawatt-hour was selling wholesale in California for $ 30. By year's end it had risen to an average $ 300 according to state officials. At peak prices have soared to $ 1500. Meanwhile demand increased last year by less than 4%. In fact demand last month was 9% less than in March 2000. ??This is the sorry news for ratepayers/ taxpayers: Californians paid $ 7.4 billion for electricity in 1999. This year the tab--without price caps--is projected at $ 70 billion. Gov. Gray Davis disclosed Tuesday that his administration has been shelling out $ 73 million a day to buy electricity for the pauper utilities. ??The profits of power producers--many of them Texans and Bush backers--have risen 400%-500%-600%. ??* ??But none of this budges the Bush administration. ??Price caps Cheney declares may provide short-term political relief for the politicians. But they don't do anything to deal with the basic fundamental problem. That problem is supply he says price caps discourage investment in new power plants and encourage consumption. ??Counters Garry South Davis' political strategist: The notion by free market zanies that you have to let profits rise 500%-600% is ludicrous. Reasonable profits can be made without bankrupting the system. They're just trying to protect the profits of their friends in the energy business. ??In truth California is building power plants as fast as it can. But not enough new megawatts apparently will be online by summer to prevent blackouts--and the bleeding of billions more into the pockets of out-of-state profiteers. ??How about a temporary price cap? ??Six months? Six years? Cheney replies. Once politicians can no longer resist the temptation to go with price caps they usually are unable to ever muster the courage to end them . . . ??I don't see that as a possibility . . . Any package you can wrap it in any fancy rhetoric you can prop it up with it does not solve the problem. ??* ??The White House clearly understands it has a problem in California--a political problem. A problem with a Democratic-dominated state that voted overwhelmingly for Al Gore. And now a problem with that mythical headline--Bush to California: Drop Dead--which seems to be getting bigger each day. ??There have been several recent California: Drop Dead stories. One was in Sunday's New York Times--Bush Devoting Scanty Attention to California. Tuesday the Sacramento Bee reported that when Cheney met with Northwest members of Congress to discuss West Coast energy he barred Californians from the room. ??Cheney flatly denies it. ??But Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) says she has had trouble making contact with the Bush White House. She has sent two letters to President Bush asking for a meeting on energy. The first time she got back a form letter with her name misspelled. On the second try she got a group meeting with Cheney. ??It was very disappointing she says. He spoke about letting the free market work and drilling in Alaska . That's not going to help California in the short-term. We need price caps until we're able to fix this very broken market. . . ??There seems no interest in really wanting to understand the California situation. ??I asked Cheney whether he sensed an anti-California bias across the country? No more than there's an anti-Texas bias he replied. I wouldn't get paranoid about it. ??The fact is California is one of the leading states in the nation. Often a trendsetter. . . . Well we hope not to emulate your energy policy. Hopefully we'll learn from that. ??His message to California: There's no reason not to be optimistic. The energy crunch obviously is a significant problem. . . . But it too will pass. ??While learning from California the Bush White House also might take a refresher course in the free market Hoover administration.

BYLINE: JENIFER WARREN and TERENCE MONMANEY TIMES STAFF WRITERS DATELINE: SACRAMENTO BODY: ??Attempting to show that no region in California is safe from sacrifice Gov. Gray Davis on Wednesday called for quick state approval of a controversial power plant proposed for the Silicon Valley. ??The governor's action locks him in combat with the San Jose City Council which has unanimously rejected the plant and Cisco Systems the computer networking giant that wants to build its worldwide headquarters on adjacent land. ??In praising the proposed plant as a model of low-polluting efficiency Davis said all regions of California must share the pain as the state expands its power supply--a key step toward ending blackouts and reducing sky-high electricity prices. ??If approved the plant would be the 14th licensed by the California Energy Commission since Davis took office. The 13th--a 510-megawatt plant near San Diego--was approved unanimously by the commission Wednesday with little controversy. ??Rushing to expand the state's overtaxed energy supply the governor has recently cut in half the approval times for the licensing of some plants. Six are under construction according to Davis and three are scheduled to begin operation this summer. A fourth--the AES Corp. generator in Huntington Beach that is due to be restarted --could add more megawatts to the supply this summer. ??V. John White an energy consultant in Sacramento said the governor's newly active role as an advocate for power plants was a necessary step given the urgency of the supply shortage. ??It's very rare and I wouldn't want him to short-circuit the commission's review process White said. But I think he's trying to reassure folks we're doing everything we can and not just sitting around in our hot tubs. ??Davis urged the Energy Commission--a five-member panel dominated by his appointees--to stop talking about the project and grant it a license. If the commission does so it will mark only the third time the panel has usurped a local government's authority over zoning. ??We are all in this together Davis said flanked by a forest of electric transformers near the Capitol. We are one state and we all have to make the sacrifices necessary to make up for the mistakes of the last 12 years when no major power plants were built. ??The governor said the plant's developers Calpine Corp. and Bechtel Enterprises Holdings Inc. have made numerous concessions to San Jose officials including an agreement to sell power exclusively in the region. ??He added that the $ 300-million plant--expected to supply about 450000 homes--will be equipped with state-of-the-art systems that make it one of the cleanest plants to go up in the nation. ??The commission's staff has recommended licensing the project and some analysts said the governor's intervention--said to be unprecedented--should fuel momentum for approval. ??Commissioner Robert Laurie--one of two members who held evidentiary hearings on the project and is preparing a recommendation for the full commission--would not comment on the plant's prospects. But Laurie an appointee of former Gov. Pete Wilson insisted that the project would receive an impartial review. ??I know the importance of independent decision-making he said. ??San Jose officials say the Calpine project conflicts with the aesthetics of its site in a bucolic valley 15 miles south of downtown. On Wednesday Mayor Ron Gonzales urged the Energy Commission to give serious attention to the city's concerns about the plant's potential impact on residents and the environment. ??As the project has been designed and proposed to operate . . . it would present an unfair burden to our community the mayor said. ??A spokeswoman for the Calpine/Bechtel partnership disagreed and characterized the plant as key to restoring energy stability in the Silicon Valley a region heavily dependent on imported power. ??This is the only project in the pipeline that can help Silicon Valley out of its predicament in the near future said the spokeswoman Lisa Poelle. ??She expressed hope that the governor's comments which cap numerous meetings between the partnership staff and Davis aides would encourage San Jose to soften its stance on the project. ??The 600-megawatt plant is proposed for a swath of open space currently leased to a rancher and occupied by grazing cattle. A preliminary ruling by Laurie and the other commissioner scrutinizing the project is expected by June. The full commission would take a final vote about a month later and if a license were granted the plant would begin operations sometime in 2003. ??From the beginning the plant has been dogged by opposition and the Energy Commission has held more than 20 hearings--an unusually large number--on its fate. ??On Wednesday a spokesman for its heftiest foe San Jose-based Cisco said the company still has serious concerns about health and safety issues. ??Cisco has strongly opposed the plant because the company wants to build a $ 1.3-billion headquarters for 20000 employees nearby. In the past Cisco officials have threatened to relocate to another state if the power plant is built. ??Company spokesman Steve Langdon said the firm's plans to build an industrial campus were not scuttled by the announcement Monday that it is cutting 8500 workers from its payroll because of slumping sales of its Internet networking equipment. ??But he suggested that the plans were flexible enough to be scaled down for a smaller work force and that the campus may not house the company's headquarters. ??It doesn't all get built at once he said. We will build and occupy the site over time in phases as needed. ??Another leading opponent of the power plant argued Wednesday that the Energy Commission lacks authority to override San Jose officials and license the project. The Santa Teresa Citizen Action Group launched by homeowners near the site says the commission may only take such a step if a better plant site hasn't been identified. ??The group charges that the commission is aware of other available sites including one in an industrial part of the East Bay area and lists eight other reasons the plant should not be built among them the noise and emissions it would produce. ??The local Sierra Club chapter however has endorsed the plant largely on grounds that it would run cleaner than existing plants in the area. By offsetting emissions from those older plants the new project would actually reduce air pollution said Kurt Newick of the Sierra Club's Loma Prieta chapter. ??On another front Davis continued to lobby legislators for support for his plan to rescue Southern California Edison from bankruptcy through purchase of the utility's transmission grid. ??Emerging from lunch with state Senate Democrats who are openly wary of the deal Davis said he'd made progress to bridge some of the gaps. It was the governor's third meeting in two days with lawmakers of both parties. ??Some of the toughest skeptics are members of his own party in the Senate. Many fear that the deal Davis struck with Edison will hand the utility too much at the expense of ratepayers and some say bankruptcy might be a better option for the state's second-largest private utility. Pacific Gas & Electric Co. filed for bankruptcy April 6. ??To assuage concerns Davis proposed that a special Senate committee be named to meet with his energy advisors as the administration and Edison finalize details of the deal before it goes to the Legislature for approval. ??Senate leader John Burton (D-San Francisco) who has called the Edison agreement problematic said he may appoint such a committee but continued to suggest that an Edison bankruptcy might be acceptable. ??Many of the Fortune 100 companies have gone into Chapter 11 bankruptcy and it ain't like the end of the world for anybody Burton said. ??* ??Times staff writer Carl Ingram contributed to this story. ??Powering Up California ??Power plant projects recently licensed by the California Energy Commission and when they are expected to go online: ??* ??* Two of four turbines are expected to go online in December 2001 the other two are expected to go online in March 2002. ??Source: California Energy Commission GRAPHIC: PHOTO: (2 photos) Gov.

Consequently its customers' power rates are expected to be stable this year while Pacific Gas and Electric Co. customers face huge rate increases. ???But municipal utilities such as Alameda's are still part of the statewide power grid which is managed by the Independent System Operator and are subject to rolling blackouts like everybody else when the state's energy reserves dip below 1.5 percent. ???Each of Alameda's four diesel generators will produce 1.5 megawatts of power. Each megawatt can light up 1000 homes utility officials say. ???The units leased at a total cost of $68000 a month through the end of the year are parked at Alameda Point. ???Their cost will be paid through the municipal utility's reserve fund and customers' power bills won't be affected said Junona Jonas the utility's general manager. ???I think in the long run we'll see more supply in the state but until that happens there will be communities that'll have to take these short-term drastic measures Jonas said. ???The utility's spokesman Matthew McCabe said the diesel exhaust from the generators won't be an environmental factor. ???Our environmental record is extremely important to us McCabe said. The diesel generators are only for emergency backup. . . . Besides these things are clean -- it's not like standing next to a diesel bus. ???The city is also getting help from the U.S. Maritime Administration which operates more than a dozen ships at the former Navy station in Alameda. When the juice is low those ships will unplug from the port and use onboard generators Jonas said. ???In the North Bay Healdsburg officials are waiting for the arrival of two diesel generators. Combined they are expected to produce 3.5 megawatts of power which can account for about 20 percent of the city's expected summer peak load said Bill Duarte city utility director. ???We're taking matters into our own hands he said. ???Farther south both Santa Clara and Palo Alto are considering leasing portable generators officials said. ???Bill Reichmann senior electric utility engineer at Santa Clara's Silicon Valley Power said the utility is planning to lease eight generators operating them in the southeastern end of town near the San Jose International Airport. ???Palo Alto's municipal utility also has recommended that the City Council approve renting two generators starting next month said spokeswoman Rima Johnson.E-mail Matthew Yi at myi@sfchronicle.com.

Gray Davis' assertion that the state is being gouged by power companies because of PG&E's bankruptcy filing. ???Such dissent from the governor's own subordinates could make it harder for Davis to gain support for his energy measures in the state Legislature. ???Despite Davis' latest claims the Department of Water Resources which is spending about $70 million a day buying power said there is no evidence linking recent price increases to Pacific Gas and Electric Co. filing for bankruptcy protection on April 6. ???It is a seller's market said Viju Patel executive manager of the Department of Water Resources' power systems department. The power companies do not need an excuse to raise prices. ???Critics say Davis' penchant for secrecy on energy issues has come back to haunt him at a time when he needs all the allies he can find. ???People aren't taking his words at face value said Michael Shames executive director of the Utility Consumers' Action Network in San Diego. ???Republican lawmakers -- and even some Democrats -- have challenged a number of the governor's initiatives including a multibillion-dollar bailout scheme for Southern California Edison. ???Nevertheless Davis reiterated his belief yesterday that recent electricity price increases are an aberration driven by the bankruptcy of PG&E. ???He said California's spending on power jumped 40 percent in the week following PG&E's bankruptcy filing because generators say they face a greater risk of not being paid. ???Nothing else in the equation has changed said Steve Maviglio a spokesman for the governor. Everything is the same except the bankruptcy. ???However power companies were quick to challenge this assertion. They insisted that PG&E's bankruptcy actually was seen as a positive development by those in the energy business. ???If anything PG&E provides some solace for traders because the bankruptcy provides an organized mechanism for recovery of payments said Gary Ackerman executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum a Menlo Park energy-industry association. ???On the other hand he acknowledged that power companies are becoming increasingly wary of the state of California's creditworthiness as an energy buyer. ???The Department of Water Resources already has spent nearly $5 billion buying electricity and has yet to recoup a dime from ratepayers. State regulators are still trying to come up with a way to apportion the limited revenues from power rates among the various parties in California's energy picture. ???Rating agency Fitch Inc. said yesterday it may cut the state's credit rating because of questions surrounding recovery of energy costs. ???People are keeping an eye on things Ackerman said. They're watching how California finances things. ???If a premium on electricity sales to the state exists he said it probably has been in place since the beginning of the year well before PG&E's current woes. ???UCAN's Shames agreed. He said power companies added a risk premium to their California power sales late last year when it looked like the state's energy troubles were worsening. ???PG&E's bankruptcy may have increased the uncertainty Shames said but we've been paying a risk premium for months now. ???Richard Wheatley a spokesman for Reliant Energy in Houston insisted that his company's traders are not using questions about PG&E's or California's financial solvency as a fresh excuse for higher prices. ???I haven't seen any evidence of it he said. ???Mark Palmer a spokesman for Houston's Enron Corp. laid blame for recent price increases on low rainfall throughout the West which has cut output at hydroelectric facilities as well as on California's chronic power shortage. ???It's not that there's a premium on prices he said. It's just supply and demand. ???That said Palmer acknowledged that California's firm insistance on blackouts being avoided at all costs leaves the state vulnerable to virtually any price generators choose to demand. ???This means prices will be used to allocate a scarce resource he said. There's no other way it could work. ???Bottom line for consumers: It's going to be a long hot summer and electricity prices will soar even higher as demand surges. ???And despite the best efforts of state officials a daily threat of blackouts remains a virtual certainty as California's beleaguered power grid is stretched to the breaking point. ???At the Department of Water Resources' command center in a Sacramento shopping mall the state's team of electricity traders has moved onto a new high-tech trading floor where they negotiate power deals each day from the crack of dawn. ???The department's Patel said daily blackouts may be averted this summer after consumers see skyrocketing power prices reflected in their bills. ???People will respond to these prices and they are going to conserve like never before Patel predicted.E-mail David Lazarus at dlazarus@sfchronicle.com.

Gray Davis urged the state Energy Commission yesterday to approve a controversial power plant in San Jose saying California needs every megawatt it can harness. ???Davis' recommendation runs counter to the wishes of the San Jose City Council and Mayor Ron Gonzales who have come out against the 600-megawatt Metcalf Energy Center in south San Jose's Coyote Valley. It also puts the governor at odds with one of his political allies Cisco Systems chief John Chambers whose company opposes the plant because it would be built near the tech firm's proposed new campus. ???Davis' announcement came the same day he all but admitted he lacks the support he needs in the state Senate for the deal he reached with Southern California Edison to restore the utility to financial health. Davis has portrayed that deal and construction of new power plants as essential to making California's energy market functional again. ???I think when we have an opportunity to put more power on line we should seize it Davis said. I believe we spend too much time talking about Metcalf. It's time to start building it. ???The Energy Commission has been reviewing the proposal by Calpine Corp. and Bechtel Enterprises Inc. for months. The commission's staff recommended in October that the plant be built and a final decision is expected by summer. If it is approved the plant could come on line next year and provide enough electricity for 600000 homes. ???None of the five commissioners could be reached yesterday. Three are Democrats appointed by Davis and two are Republicans appointed by former Gov. Pete Wilson. ???Gonzales and the rest of the City Council rejected the Metcalf plant in November. Until yesterday Davis had sat on the sidelines as the energy crisis deepened and a long line of state and federal officials including four of the five Assembly members from Silicon Valley urged the commission to overturn the council's vote. ???Some neighborhood groups oppose the plant along with computer networking giant Cisco which hopes to build a 20000-worker campus on a neighboring parcel. Cisco chief Chambers donated $50000 to Davis in the first six months of last year. ???Cisco's reaction yesterday was restrained. ???We have great respect for the governor and respect his decision said Cisco spokesman Steve Langdon. ???However Langdon added: We still have serious concerns about health and safety issues related to the proposed power plant. ???Some neighbors were much angrier. ???He's trying to act like he's the big bad tough governor and he's spineless said Issa Ajlouny who lives in the Santa Teresa neighborhood less than a mile from the proposed plant. He knows the approval process isn't working in his favor so he's trying to come out and act like a hero to the state of California. But he's nothing but backstabbing the city of San Jose on the environmental issues. ???Supporters of the plant see the 14 acres of former junkyard as the perfect site -- right next to Pacific Gas and Electric Co.'s largest substation in the South Bay close to major transmission lines and shielded from its neighbors by a 350-foot hill. ???But a housing development is also nearby and residents fear the power plant will belch pollutants in an area already suffering from some of the worst air quality in the Bay Area. ???Mayor Gonzales continued to express his concern yesterday. ???I would support clean power plants that will help us achieve greater energy self-sufficiency for San Jose residents and business Gonzales said. As the Metcalf project has been designed and proposed to operate however it would present an unfair burden on our community. ???That's not what Davis said however calling Metcalf one of the cleanest most efficient plants in the country. ???Davis praised the efforts of Calpine/Bechtel to work with the local community and said he was especially pleased that the venture had agreed to commit all the power to the local region. ???The Silicon Valley is obviously the engine driving our economy but they are very dependent on outside power Davis said. ???Also in Sacramento yesterday after an hourlong session with Senate Democrats -- the toughest legislative sell for Davis' proposed Edison deal -- the governor all but admitted his plan could not win enough votes for Senate approval. ???I think he knew there weren't enough votes going in said Sen. Don Perata D-Oakland. But there may be a way of perfecting a deal people can at least think of supporting. ???Senate Democrats have openly opposed Edison's deal saying the only beneficiaries are Edison shareholders and power generators who would be paid every cent owed them by the utility -- at the expense of customers who would pay more to erase Edison's debt. ???Unlike his meeting with Assembly Democrats after which Davis said he was encouraged the governor said yesterday he wanted the Senate to appoint a special committee to iron out differences over the Edison deal. ???Senate President Pro Tem John Burton D-San Francisco said he was not aware a committee was being set up.

Hydro's credit to California firms exceeded 1999 guidelines BYLINE: David Baines SOURCE: Vancouver Sun BODY: ??A confidential document issued in late 1999 shows that B.C. Hydro's power-trading subsidiary Powerex set a credit limit of $100 million US for its California customers. ??However by the end of 2000 Powerex had extended three times that amount of credit to those customers -- the California Independent System Operator and the California Power Exchange. With the California Power Exchange and Cal-ISO's major customer Pacific Gas & Electric under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection repayment of this debt is now in doubt. ??Powerex spokesman Wayne Cousins noted that the document obtained by The Vancouver Sun which is marked strictly confidential was issued in November 1999. ??That's an old copy of our risk-management policy he said in an interview Wednesday. ??Credit limits have changed since then based on careful assessment of several factors including market conditions risks maintaining long-standing relationships and helping California meet its electricity needs to prevent crisis situations. ??Temporary revisions were only implemented after very diligent review incorporating the best market intelligence available our own due diligence and on-going dialogue with appropriate market participants. ??He refused to say when the credit limits for Cal-ISO and the California Power Exchange were increased. ??That type of information is confidential. You have a copy that I assume was leaked in some way but this is commercially confidential information. ??He said the increase in credit limits helped B.C. Hydro achieve record net income of about $1 billion during the year ending March 31. This figures does not include any write-downs that may occur if Powerex determines that any of its customer accounts are not collectible. ??Cousins however was insistent that all debts will be collected: We continue to pursue monies owing and we expect to be paid for electricity we have sold. ??He noted that Powerex suspended trades to all California entities on Dec. 8 unless those trades were fully secured by creditworthy customers. ??By that time Cal-ISO and California had racked up an unpaid bill of about $ 300 million US or $475 million Cdn -- about half the net income that Hydro has tentatively reported for the year ending March 31. ??The confidential document states that Powerex's policies and procedures are designed to control the risk of financial loss due to changes in market prices or volatility and the risk that a counterparty (customer) in a commodity transaction defaults on delivery and/or settlement. ??It states that the amount of credit to be advanced to any customer depends on its credit rating. An AAA customer for example may be granted credit to a maximum of $20 million. ??Cal-ISO and California Power Exchange are not utilities they are power pools. They purchase power from Powerex and other suppliers and re-sell it to utilities such as Pacific Gas & Electric and Southern California Edison. ??The pools are not rated but are assigned specific credit limits. As of November 1999 Cal-ISO had a credit limit of $40 million US and the California Power Exchange $60 million US. ??The risk-management document notes that the credit-worthiness of these pools depends on that of its suppliers. ??The Powerex credit-risk manager and the treasury manager are responsible for initially evaluating and then monitoring the credit-authorization policies and credit limits for each power pool in which Powerex trades the document states. Significant alterations in the credit policies of a power pool will trigger a mandatory reappraisal of the power-pool credit limit. ??California has been caught in a power vice in recent months. The problem dates back to 1996 when the state developed a plan to deregulate the electricity business. Competition was supposed to lower rates below a price cap that had been imposed. ??However dry conditions cut the ability to generate hydro-electric power and a surge in the state's economy created unprecedented demand for electricity. Prices soared. ??The result was that the California utilities paid record prices for power but weren't allowed to pass along the full cost to consumers. ??Pacific Gas & Electric and Southern California Edison the state's two biggest utilities now owe about $12 billion. ??dbaines@pacpress.southam.ca TYPE: Business LOAD-DATE: April 19 2001 of 63 DOCUMENTS ???????????????????The Associated Press State & Local Wire The materials in the AP file were compiled by The Associated Press. ?These materials may not be republished without the express written consent of The Associated Press. ?????????????????????April 18 2001 Wednesday BC cycle SECTION: Business News LENGTH: 348 words HEADLINE: Williams again target of overcharging allegations from federal regulators DATELINE: TULSA Okla.

BODY: ??Gov. Mike Johanns and Rep. Lee Terry R-Neb. said Wednesday they will be working to make sure national leaders understand Nebraska's stance on a national energy policy. ??Nebraska's unique status as the only 100 percent public power state in the nation and its reliance on the corn-based fuel additive ethanol make the state's input in the development of national energy policy important Johanns said. ??Public power has worked very well for Nebraska consumers by providing low cost electricity he said adding that the deregulated state of California has suffered through weeks of rolling blackouts. We are committed to protecting public power in this environment of deregulation. ??Terry said he has talked at length to the staff of Vice President Dick Cheney who has been tapped to come up with a national energy policy draft.

Gray Davis is expected to announce today his support for Calpine Corp.'s proposed South San Jose power plant -- a move that could ensure the state's most controversial power project is built. ??Davis said for months that he would not interfere in the environmental review of the proposed 600-megawatt power plant. But a source close to the governor said Davis has decided to use Calpine's Coyote Valley project to send a signal that California is ready to build more power plants and is open to business. ??San Jose has strenuously opposed the power plant. But Davis' decision to urge the California Energy Commission to approve it would likely hold sway with the agency which has authority over where plants are located but has almost never overridden local opposition. ??The commission -- three of whose five members were appointed by Davis -- is expected to complete its environmental review and make a decision early this summer. ??A spokesman for the governor declined to confirm the endorsement. But late Tuesday the governor scheduled a press conference for this morning to make an important energy generation announcement. ??San Jose Mayor Ron Gonzales declined to comment. But another of the plant's leading opponents pledged to keep fighting what would be the South Bay's largest power plant. ??An endorsement from Davis would cap a stunning turnaround for the project. ??Five months ago Calpine's Metcalf Energy Center was unanimously rejected by the San Jose City Council which decided that the power plant would be incompatible with the city's plans to develop high-tech campuses in North Coyote Valley. ??Some Calpine officials even considered giving up plans to build the power plant. ??But as California's energy woes intensified the Metcalf plant increasingly became a poster child for the need for more power generation to reduce the skyrocketing cost of electricity and avoid rolling blackouts. Silicon Valley one of the state's largest electricity consumers produces only a fraction of the energy it uses. ??Despite fierce opposition from local residents concerned about the environmental effects of a large power plant a steady stream of state and local organizations lined up behind the project including the Silicon Valley Manufacturing Group the San Jose Silicon Valley Chamber of Commerce and the local chapters of the Sierra Club and American Lung Association. ??The California Assembly voted unanimously in February to urge the energy commission to override San Jose and license the power plant. ??And top officials and attorneys at the energy commission have been working for months to ensure that the project wins approval a Mercury News investigation of the commission's environmental review of the project showed. The officials undermined negative environmental assessments of the Metcalf site and silenced commission analysts who said other sites would be better. ??The energy commissioners are weighing the staff's recommendation to approve the plant. ??Commissioner Robert A. Laurie who oversaw hearings on the project insisted at one hearing two months ago that the commission would complete an independent review. ??Although Davis has stressed his efforts to speed construction of new power plants the governor insisted he would not take a position on the project. ??The governor has repeatedly said he wants the process to play out Davis press secretary Steve Maviglio said last week. The governor believes the energy commission should complete its review. ??But there have been growing signs that Davis would throw his weight behind Calpine's project. ??A senior energy commission official said aides to the governor have been calling the commission for months to urge quick approval of the Metcalf plant. The governor's press secretary said no calls have been made. ??When Davis was looking for a backdrop to hold a press conference earlier this year to announce his plans to speed up approval of new power plants he chose Calpine's new plant in Sutter. ??The company also has actively campaigned for the governor's support. ??Earlier this year Calpine offered to sell the state cheaper power from the plant if it is approved. ??When Calpine and its development partner Bechtel Enterprises were looking for a lobbyist in Sacramento the companies turned to Platinum Advisors whose president Darius Anderson was finance chairman of Davis' 1998 gubernatorial campaign. ??The San Jose-based company gave the governor $ 19000 last year according to state campaign finance reports. ??Maviglio said the governor's ties to Calpine are no different from his relationship with Cisco Systems CEO John Chambers who has opposed the power plant. Campaign finance reports show Chambers gave Davis $ 50000 last year. ??Calpine officials said Tuesday they did not know of the governor's impending announcement. But they said they were not surprised. We've been working with the governor on a number of issues said project manager Ken Abreu. Metcalf is just one of them. ??Meanwhile Calpine's opponents in San Jose City Hall and in the neighborhood nearest the proposed power plant appear more isolated than at any time since the contentious debate over the Metcalf site began more than two years ago. ??Mayor Gonzales refused to comment on Davis' planned announcement. I don't respond to rumors said the mayor who has helped lead opposition to Metcalf. I have not heard anything. If he makes a statement I'll respond. ??But one of Calpine's fiercest local opponents said the nearby Santa Teresa neighborhood will continue to fight. We have a strong case said longtime South San Jose resident Issa Ajlouny. And we will win. ??The Mercury News strives to avoid use of unnamed sources.

Howard News Service 18 2001 Wednesday SECTION: DOMESTIC NEWS LENGTH: 588 words HEADLINE: Davis says Edison agreement may need altering SOURCE: Scripps-McClatchy Western Service BYLINE: EMILY BAZAR and KEVIN YAMAMURA DATELINE: SACRAMENTO Calif. BODY: ??Gov. Gray Davis indicated Wednesday that he may need to alter the agreement to purchase Southern California Edison's transmission lines if he wants legislators to approve the deal. ??Though the Democratic governor declined to discuss particulars he said he asked Senate leaders to appoint a special committee dedicated to resolving disagreements between the administration and lawmakers. ??Many provisions of the memorandum of understanding the document that lays out the terms of the Edison deal must be approved by the Legislature and the state Public Utilities Commission. ??There is a determination to try and solve this problem whether or not it means amending the MOU or trying a slightly different approach Davis said after meeting with Senate Democrats. ??A spokesman for the utility declined to comment on the governor's statements. ??Davis announced the Edison agreement April 9 just three days after Pacific Gas & Electric Co. unexpectedly cut off transmission line negotiations with the governor and filed for bankruptcy protection. ??The deal would require the state to pay $2.76 billion for Edison's transmission lines or 2.3 times book value. In addition a portion of consumer electricity rates would be dedicated to paying off the remainder of the utility's debt estimated at about $5 billion. ??Both Edison and PG&E stockpiled massive debt when wholesale electricity prices soared. Price caps prevented them from passing along the entire cost of electricity to consumers. ??Since the Edison deal was announced however legislators have been critical of certain provisions suggesting that California consumers will receive little in return for relieving the utility of billions of dollars in debt. ??It's clear that the deal as is could well be problematic said Senate President Pro Tem John Burton D-San Francisco. This has to do with what's in the bill what's in it for the people of the state. ??Lawmakers initially believed they would have little ability to change the agreement and referred to it as a take it or leave it deal. ??In fact the memorandum of understanding itself says the deal can be nullified in the event any law is passed adopted or repealed ... (which) would materially impede or frustrate the ability of the Parties to effectuate all of the elements of the plan as a package. ??But in his meeting with Senate Democrats Davis indicated he may be willing to compromise. His goal he said is to keep Edison from following PG&E into bankruptcy. ??We still have some work to do Davis said. I think the appointment of a special Senate committee assuming that happens will let us work through the detail in an appropriate fashion. ??Burton said he has not decided whether to appoint a committee. ??Other senators came out of the meeting guardedly optimistic that they could compromise with the governor. ??It was obvious that there were concerns from members said Sen. Don Perata D-Alameda. He is open and ready to have the proposal perfected as it moves through the legislative process. ??Sen. Jackie Speier D-Hillsborough said she hopes to amend the deal to ensure power generators are penalized for over-charging the utilities and the state for electricity. ??The way it's presently crafted (generators) are being rewarded she said. They are getting a premium for selling electricity at a higher premium than ever conceived of by humankind. ??(Contact Emily Bazar and Kevin Yamamura of the Sacramento Bee in California at http://www.sacbee.com.)

901,possible RTP conference,Dear Mr. Kaminski: Thank you for talking with me about a possible RTP conference. I would like to include some discussions of what has been learned in other industries. As I indicated Frank Wolak suggested that I contact you. In discussing power markets with Frank and other colleagues at Stanford and EPRI it seems quite evident that real-time pricing for retail customers is the forgotten resource in more efficient power markets. There seems to be a lot of confusion about what RTP means and it also seems that many researchers need to address some practical but important problems. I was asked whether a group like Stanford's EMF might explore this topic and give it the visibility that would have it considered more seriously by policymakers. Frank thought that you might be someone who could help me structure a useful approach and who might also see whether Enron could become a major sponsor. I was hoping that this issue was sufficiently important to Enron that the company might consider providing $25000. As you may appreciate it requires some thought and effort to make sure that the product of the conference is widely circulated among key government groups. I would be very interested in hearing from you if you can provide ideas and recommendations for people (perhaps yourself or a colleague) to participate. I would also appreciate any consideration by Enron of providing funding for this effort. Thank you Hill Huntington - retail notes.rtf Hillard G.

906,Re: news/updates,As to whether long term contracting by Cal. is a good idea the answer is somewhat mixed. We were one of the early parties pointing out the problems with total reliance on the spot market and encouraging more forward contracting. Given the utilities' precarious financial position there were two options: 1) outsource the default provider obligation to the market (this is what we prefer but there was no political support for it) or 2) have the state put its credit behind the purchases. California is pursuing the latter with CDWR prucahsing the utilities' requirements. In the short term we have criticized the state's plan because it contemplates state takeover of the grid state participation in power plant financing construction and ownership and they have not made it clear that CDWR really has the money to pay for all the purchases. I am attaching text I have used as the base for a number of communications with policymakers. Mark Schroeder@ECT 03/11/2001 02:11 PM To: Richard Shapiro/NA/Enron@Enron Steven J Kean/NA/Enron@Enron cc: Subject: news/updates In the press I saw two news stories that I wondered if we (Enron) had any role/hand in and what was the offical spin in both cases. 1) The FERC Order requiring something like 55-65 million dollars in refunds by generators (or did it include traders) for overcharging in California in December if I recall my facts/news stories correctly and 2) the reports of 40 companies entering into 10-year contracts with California (touted by Davis). Was Enron a contracting party?

913,,Got your message. I'm testifying at the Congressional hearing and Dasovich is covering FERC. I think Jeff's comments were taken out of context. He said policymakers do need to take care of small customers whose bills are tripling. Frankly we'd get slaughtered if we said anything else. But he also said there is a right way and a wrong way to do it. Enron and others had provided a market based answer by offering a fixed price deal to SDG&E (which would have enabled them to cap rates to those who had not switched. California elected instead to cap rates and deficit spend (ie create a deferral account). I don't think we can stand for anything that doesn't protect the small customers but we can continue to emphasize the market based solutions.

936,Re:,These are good fixes. I still think it's important for our security people to be able to recognize all of our senior executives and make sure their guests get where they are going quickly. To: Steven J Kean/HOU/EES@EES cc: Susan Skarness/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: Follow-up Steve - Following up on our conversation Friday we have advised Cliff Baxter's Assistant that effective immediately Cliff and his quests can pass through Security on the Plaza without showing his access card or requiring his quests to sign in or identify themselves. All he needs to do is approach the front Reception Desks and asking for entry. The receptionists will recognise Cliff by sight and ensure that he and his quests pass through - without delay - by lifting the adjacent rope. We are asking Cliff to use his badge at the card readers as per standard procedure when he is entering the building by himself. We are also refining procedures and upgrading our IT systems/data base @ the Reception Desk to make it easier on a visitor of any employee. For example if you call down to the Plaza Reception Desk and advise that a visitor is expected the receptionist will have a pass prepared so as to eliminate the sign in process. The guest simply has to exchange their business card for the visitor pass. Or if an employee shows their access card at the Reception Desk and asks that their guest gain entry that guest can get a badge without signing in.

941,RTO Legal Question,I am working on an analysis of the details of the Barton draft RTO language. While it is highly objectionable and our goal is to kill it to do so we need to respond to requests to be specific about why we don't like it. One of the more objectionable provisions says that FERC can't change the scope governance etc. of any RTO that has been approved under Order 2000 prior to enactment of the legislation. If this applies to PJM the legislation would stop the Northeast-wide RTO in its tracks since several of you and PJM's Phil Harris testified last week that FERC has approved PJM. By contrast committee staff and the section-by-section they distributed on the RTO legislative proposal say that to date FERC has NOT approved any RTOs under Order 2000. They say that the legislative language would not apply to any RTO as of this date because FERC approvals of PJM Cal ISO and NePool have been approved under the ISO principles of Order 888. Your thoughts on the above would be helpful. Either way I think we can argue that the provision shows why the Barton proposal is a retrenchment rather than an advancement on RTOs. If it does not apply to PJM and the others as they contend there is no good reason to include it other than to freeze the process at FERC merely by having the legislation pending on the Hill much less enacted into law.,"Energy; RTOs; Legislation; FERC

    The provision in question appears to create a potential conflict regarding the regulatory status of certain RTOs, specifically PJM, Cal ISO, and NePool.

Emshwiller Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal 05/22/2001 The Wall Street Journal A2 (Copyright (c) 2001 Dow Jones & Company Inc.) LOS ANGELES -- California may be struggling to keep its lights on but one thing there is no shortage of is accusations over who is to blame for an electricity crisis that has sent power prices skyrocketing. In recent days top California officials have stepped up their rhetoric against a handful of merchant power companies many of them Texas-based that supply the state with much of its juice. Gov. Gray Davis says companies such as Reliant Energy Inc. of Houston have engaged in unconscionable price gouging. Loretta Lynch president of the California Public Utilities Commission and a Davis appointee proclaims that a cartel of electricity producers has created artificial shortages. Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante is backing a bill that would make energy price fixing a felony and as a private citizen he is suing several major power producers in Los Angeles state court. About half a dozen investigations are being conducted by entities ranging from state legislative committees to the California attorney general's office. So far these probes -- some of which have been under way for months -- haven't yet yielded either civil or criminal charges. While the energy suppliers are generating unconscionable profits the question remains whether they are illegal profits says California Attorney General Bill Lockyer who has offered rewards of as much as hundreds of millions of dollars for information about lawbreaking in the energy business. Mr. Lockyer says he believes his office will eventually file civil charges against suppliers. He would very much like to add criminal counts. I would love to personally escort [Enron Corp. Chairman Kenneth] Lay to an 8 x 10 cell that he could share with a tattooed dude who says `Hi my name is Spike honey' adds Mr. Lockyer. Houston-based Enron is a major energy-trading company. Like other such firms Enron has denied wrongdoing in the California market. Mark Palmer Enron's vice president for corporate communications said Mr. Lockyer's comment about Mr. Lay is so counterproductive that it doesn't merit a response. Investigators and academics say there is abundant evidence that individual firms have been exercising market power. This term is used to denote efforts to influence wholesale-electricity prices such as by withholding supplies. The California Independent System Operator or ISO which manages the state's electric transmission grid estimates that by exercising market power suppliers may have added about $6.8 billion to the cost of electricity in the state since early last year. A single firm exercising such power isn't necessarily illegal says Severin Borenstein director of the University of California Energy Institute. If a company is a large supplier in the state and you're not exercising market power you are not doing your job on behalf of shareholders he says. Mr. Borenstein and others say that there are steps that should be taken against suppliers. They note that under federal power law the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission can order refunds for wholesale prices that are above just and reasonable levels. So far FERC has tentatively ordered California suppliers to make tens of millions of dollars of such refunds as part of that agency's ongoing inquiry into the California market. Critics of the suppliers and FERC say the refunds should be in the billions of dollars. The power industry not surprisingly says there is nothing to accusations of price manipulation or collusion. Executives point to a botched state-utility-deregulation plan that relies heavily on volatile spot-market purchases. Suppliers note that over the past decade California didn't build enough new power plants to keep up with demand growth. The allegations of manipulation are a lot of sound and fury and they won't produce anything says Gary Ackerman executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum an industry trade group. Power generators also point to sharp increases in some of their costs particularly natural gas which is a major power-plant fuel. This rise in natural-gas prices also has set off a flurry of investigations over possible manipulation. One such case involving El Paso Corp. Houston is the subject of probes by federal and state officials. El Paso denies any wrongdoing. While power-industry officials say they have been cooperating with the investigations law-enforcement officials say they have hit some roadblocks. For instance Mr. Lockyer's office has gone to San Francisco state court to enforce subpoenas against Reliant Houston-based Dynegy Inc. and Southern Co. and Mirant Corp. both of Atlanta after the companies resisted turning over certain business documents they deemed confidential. Investigators have zeroed in on the increased frequency with which plants are going out of service for unscheduled outages. At times several thousand fewer megawatts of capacity are available than a year ago. A thousand megawatts can power about one million homes. Generators say that this increased forced outage rate shows that tight supplies over the past year have required them to run plants some of them more than 40 years old for long periods without routine maintenance. This combination has produced more breakdowns. Plants have been running flat out says Tom Williams a spokesman for Duke Energy Co. Charlotte N.C. which says that its California power plants produced 50% more electricity in 2000 than in 1999. At the same time during periods of lower demand the number of unplanned outages often seems to rise enough to keep supplies tight says Frank Wolak a Stanford University professor and chairman of the ISO's market surveillance committee. Clearly something is going on here. However he and others say that it is almost impossible to tell why a particular pipe failed or whether such a failure was a legitimate reason to reduce output. Some of the most intriguing evidence to date about forced outages surfaced in a federal case. FERC officials said an investigation had raised questions about whether two major power companies had taken plants out of service in order to reap higher electricity prices. The charges against AES Corp. Arlington Va. which owns the plants and Williams Cos. Tulsa Okla. which markets their output asserted that those actions allowed the companies to reap an extra $10.8 million in revenue. In one instance according to case filings a Williams employee indicated to AES officials that his firm wouldn't financially penalize AES for extending an outage at one plant. This conversation which was voluntarily divulged by Williams could be an indication of collusion. Williams and AES settled the case without admitting any wrongdoing by paying back $8 million to the ISO and by taking certain other measures. A Williams spokeswoman says the employee who talked to AES was counseled not to enter into any conversations of that nature in the future. Another issue raised by the FERC case touched on maintenance procedures. According to the filings AES stopped doing a certain procedure to keep its plant's cooling system from getting clogged. The clogging of the system was cited as a reason for one of the forced outages. Mark Woodruff president of the AES unit that operates the plant in question says the company substituted what it felt was an equally effective maintenance procedure. If someone was looking to keep supplies tight and prices high changes in maintenance procedures would be an easy way to ensure that plants particularly old ones have frequent forced outages says a senior utility-industry executive. By restricting maintenance resources he says an operator can simply allow a plant to take itself out of service. --- Journal Link: What is California doing to alleviate the energy crisis? See a video report of California State Treasurer Philip Angelides discussing the state's plans in the online Journal at WSJ.com/JournalLinks. --- Investigations Aplenty In the year since California's energy deregulation plan began resulting in higher prices and even blackouts a flurry of investigations has gotten under way. Here are the main ones: AGENCY: Federal Energy Regulatory Commission INVESTIGATION: Whether generators are charging more than just and reasonable rates as demanded by the Federal Power Act whether El Paso Corp. used its position as a major natural-gas supplier to the state to illegally drive up the price of fuel used to generate electricity. AGENCY: California Public Utilities Commission and the State Attorney General INVESTIGATION: Whether generators and power traders have acted illegally through collusion or other means to artificially inflate electricity prices.

Business/Financial Desk Section W Enron Unit Moves to End India Contract For Power By SARITHA RAI 05/22/2001 The New York Times Page 1 Column 6 c. 2001 New York Times Company BANGALORE India May 21 -- Fed up with its main customer's refusal to pay its bills the Enron Corporation's Indian power-generating venture served formal notice on Saturday that it would terminate its power supply contract and pull out. The move by the Dabhol Power Company 65 percent owned by Enron starts the clock ticking on a six-month notice period before the contract is voided during which negotiations to settle the dispute are expected. The $2.9 billion Dabhol project represents the largest single foreign investment in India. Separately Enron said today that it was withdrawing from a pipeline project in Qatar which would have supplied some gas to Dabhol. The company said that the two steps were unrelated. The Dabhol project has been the subject of a series of wrangles between the company and the governments of India and of the western Indian state of Maharashtra. The state-owned utility company that contracted to buy power from the Dabhol plant has defaulted on some $64 million in unpaid power bills and has accused Dabhol of charging too much. Dabhol said it was left with little choice but to issue the termination notice after both governments failed to honor their contractual commitments to buy and pay for its output. But in a statement issued over the weekend Dabhol said it was ''still open to constructive discussion on the solutions.'' The company said a ''lasting and feasible solution'' to the dispute would require that the two governments either honor their obligations to buy Dabhol's power or find other creditworthy buyers to take the power instead. The first phase of the project now generates 740 megawatts of power and the second phase adding another 1444 megawatts of capacity is scheduled to go on line next month. Under the contract the termination that Enron has set in motion would oblige the federal and state governments to pay damages to Enron and the lenders that financed the project possibly as much as $500 million -- the value of a year's output of power plus the project's $300 million in debt -- if it is shut down.

California Metro Desk The State GOP Criticizes Davis' Choice of PR Aides Capitol: Legislative leaders call the pair political operatives who are too partisan to represent the state during energy crisis. DAN MORAIN TIMES STAFF WRITER 05/22/2001 Los Angeles Times Home Edition B-8 Copyright 2001 / The Times Mirror Company SACRAMENTO -- Republican legislative leaders Monday blasted Gov. Gray Davis' decision to spend $30000 a month in taxpayer money to retain communications consultants known for their highly partisan work. Labeling consultants Mark Fabiani and Chris Lehane as cut-throat Senate GOP leader Jim Brulte of Rancho Cucamonga and Assembly Republican leader Dave Cox of Fair Oaks said in a letter to Davis that the hiring undermines the assertions you have made both publicly and privately throughout this crisis. Davis announced Friday that he retained the duo and that the state will pay them a combined $30000 a month for at least the next six months. We're not going to support the hiring of political hacks on government payroll Brulte said in an interview. Lehane and Fabiani are very talented. The issue is which payroll is appropriate. . . . These are political opposition research attack dogs. If the governor wants them he ought to pay for them with his $30-million political war chest. Some consumer advocates also criticized the move citing the consultants' work on behalf of Southern California Edison. In their private consulting business Fabiani and Lehane are working to win over public and political support for Davis' $3.5-billion plan to rescue Edison from its financial difficulties. Legislation embodying aspects of the deal is pending in Sacramento. On Monday Brulte and Cox also complained about the consultants' dual role. California taxpayers should not be asked to finance political consultants or individuals who have a vested business interest with the state the letter said. Fabiani and Lehane had worked in the Clinton administration and in Vice President Al Gore's presidential campaign where they gained a reputation as attack-oriented operatives. Lehane on Monday defended the governor's decision to use tax money to pay their fees saying government often hires outside experts and that he and Fabiani will serve as communications advisors to help the governor fight against these generators. The Republicans Lehane added ought to be spending time writing letters to George W. Bush to get him to stop the Texas generators from gouging California. . . . That is the real issue here. Davis meanwhile returned to California on Monday after a weekend of fund-raisers. He was in Texas on Saturday for a Dallas event that had been scheduled for April 11. It was postponed when Pacific Gas & Electric filed for bankruptcy protection. There is a very large fund-raising base for Democrats in Texas Davis' campaign strategist Garry South said of the state that is home to some of the generators that Davis has criticized. Davis traveled to Chicago for another fund-raiser Sunday then met Monday with city officials to discuss how Chicago deals with electrical blackouts. After blackouts crippled downtown Chicago in the summer of 1999 Mayor Richard M. Daley demanded that the city's electricity provider Commonwealth Edison give advance notice of power cuts. Customers now sometimes receive warnings two or three days in advance. Davis emerged from the meeting saying the utilities have got to tell us in advance when they're going to have a planned blackout. It was not however readily apparent how Chicago's solutions would translate to California because its electrical problems are vastly different. Rather than suffering a shortage of electricity throughout the grid like California Chicago has the more microcosmic ills of an aging system--an obsolete transformer going down for example leaving several city blocks in the dark until workers can fix it. * Times staff writer Eric Slater contributed to this story.

EUROPE/MIDEAST Insurer Storebrand Favors Sampo's Bid Over Den Norske Norway's largest insurer Storebrand became the center of a bidding war between Finnish financial-services company Sampo and Norway's Den Norske Bank with Storebrand favoring Sampo. Sampo's offer values Storebrand at 20.8 billion Norwegian kroner ($2.3 billion) compared with DnB's 17.6 billion kroner bid as the Nordic region's top financial companies battle for position in a consolidating sector. Sampo and Storebrand in a joint Helsinki news conference said they were confident their deal would succeed. Sampo's cash-and-stock offer valued at 75 kroner a share represents a 31% premium to Storebrand's average share price during the past month and was backed by Storebrand's management. DnB wouldn't say whether it would alter its bid. One cannot count on that its chairman said. HypoVereinsbank Results Disappoint Bayerische Hypo- und Vereinsbank Germany's second-largest bank known as HypoVereinsbank said first-quarter pretax profit rose 25% from a year earlier to 770 million euros ($678 million) below analysts' consensus forecast of 795 million euros. Profit rose 63% to 468 million euros earnings and pretax profit were both helped by one-time gains of 454 million euros. Operating profit fell 59% in the retail-banking division to 98 million euros and was down 43% in the international-markets division to 184 million euros. HypoVereinsbank said tough market conditions world-wide reduced regular commission and interest income.

He didn't specify the reason for Enron's withdrawal or the value of Enron's stake. The Dolphin project agreement reached two years ago by UOG and Qatar Petroleum aims to bring two billion cubic feet a day of natural gas from Qatar's offshore North Field in the Persian Gulf to Abu Dhabi and onward to Dubai. Enron and France's TotalFinaElf each held a 24.5% stake with UOG owning the remaining 51%. Mr. Sayigh said UOG will hold discussions with other companies on a possible sale of Enron's original stake. Richard Bergester manager for Enron Middle East said that having contributed to the project's initial stages Enron now feels it can't add any more. He didn't elaborate. A TotalFinaElf official said it is interested in a greater stake in Dolphin.

Copyright  2000 Dow Jones & Company Inc. All Rights Reserved. INDIA: UPDATE 1-Indian state spurred by Enron reopens power deals. By Narayanan Madhavan 05/22/2001 Reuters English News Service (C) Reuters Limited 2001. BANGALORE India May 22 (Reuters) - India's technology state of Karnataka spurred by a payments row involving U.S. power developer Enron Corp in a neighbouring province has reopened sealed power purchase deals with 11 private firms. The southern state's government has told independent power producers (IPPs) which are yet to start generation that they need to make their tariffs more competitive officials said. Now it (electricity) cannot be at any cost V.P. Baligar chairman and managing director of the Karnataka State Power Transmission Corp Ltd (KPTCL) the state's monopoly power distributor told Reuters in an interview late on Monday. The move comes on the heels of the bitter wrangle in Maharashtra state involving Dabhol Power Co 65-percent owned by Houston-based Enron. Dabhol issued a preliminary notice on Saturday to end a contract to sell power to the Maharashtra State Electricity Board. The step came after Maharashtra ceased payments saying Dabhol's tariffs were too high. The $2.9-billion project which is 90-percent complete was first billed as a showcase of India's decade-old reform programme but now is regarded by critics as a symbol of policy bungling. Enron is a lesson for all of us Baligar said. Karnataka also said it would not provide financial assurances in the form of escrow cover and government loan guarantees which the firms wanted to help sweeten lending rates. We're trying to tell them your tariff has to be competitive Baligar said but added that the state was open to negotiations. You have to have the final capability so you can implement the project without any guarantee or escrow. SIGNED DEALS Five years ago the state signed power purchase deals with 14 private firms. Three of them are already generating power at rates higher than the state would now like to pay. They will continue to get these rates but the 11 unbuilt units face an uncertain future. The 11 plants involve 2000 megawatts (MW) of capacity half of which would be supplied by the Mangalore Power Co (MPC) from which U.S.-based Cogentrix exited in 1999 citing litigation and delays in government approval. China Light & Power now owns the company in which India's Tata group is expected to take 30 percent. MPC Managing Director V.P. Sharma told Reuters that his firm's project would not be hit by the demand for lower tariffs because it was based on coal unlike the Enron project based on naphtha. Our cost is the lowest cost approved (and) coal prices have fallen (since the agreement) Sharma told Reuters from Bombay. Company officials say the project is also looking forward to a federal guarantee to help it move forward. Baligar said the government's intention was to weed out those who are not serious. Those who are serious can sit with us and sort out their problems he said. Power tariffs vary depending upon foreign exchange rates and the type and prices of fuels. Three projects which are already generating power get about 3.0 to 4.0 rupees (6.4 to 8.5 U.S. cents) per unit. The 11 uninstalled plants had comparable rates but MPC says falling coal prices helped its competitiveness. One generating firm Jindal Tractabel which uses coal and gas gets about 2.60 rupees. Its purchase agreement was not among the 14 and is awaiting regulatory approval. The state wants the Jindal rate to be the benchmark for reopened agreements. If private firms cut capital costs and work out long-term fuel supplies they will be able to cut rates Baligar said. The state says it needs 4000 MW of new capacity over 10 years and 2500 MW over five years. State-run utilities are in a position to meet five-year needs at low rates Baligar said. Asked if Karnataka could face litigation over the reopening of the contracts Baligar had legally strong arguments. ( $1 = 46.9 rupees). Copyright  2000 Dow Jones & Company Inc. All Rights Reserved. INDIA: India utility may slap 4bln rupee fine on Enron unit. 05/22/2001 Reuters English News Service (C) Reuters Limited 2001. BOMBAY May 22 (Reuters) - An Indian utility is planning to impose a second penalty of four billion rupees ($85 million) on Enron's local unit barely a week after the U.S. energy giant took its first step to pull out of the embattled project. A senior official at the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) said on Tuesday the fine on Dabhol Power Company (DPC) was for not meeting capacity targets within a stipulated period. We will do this as soon as the bill for May is received next month the official told Reuters. DPC officials declined to comment on the matter. Earlier this year MSEB had imposed a similar penalty on DPC - which DPC has not paid - saying its plant could not be ramped up to full capacity within three hours from a cold start. Enron and MSEB have been battling for six months over payment defaults and last week DPC owned 65 percent by Enron issued a preliminary notice to terminate a power purchase agreement - widely seen as a move that would lead to a pull out. According to DPC it is owed $48 million by MSEB. A top government official told Reuters in Delhi on Monday the federal government is optimistic Houston-based Enron and the Maharashtra state will resolve their wrangle. The agreement signed between MSEB and DPC in 1995 stipulates that if Dabhol's plant cannot achieve 100 percent capacity within three hours from restart MSEB is entitled to impose a penalty. The MSEB official said the plant had failed to fulfil this condition in February and March considered peak periods for power demand by the utility. DPC is building a $2.9 billion 2184 MW plant of which the first phase of 740 MW began operations in May 1999. Enron is India's largest foreign investor. ($1=47.0 Indian rupees).

Power corrupts... 05/22/2001 The Economic Times Copyright (C) 2001 The Economic Times Source: World Reporter (TM) APROPOS of Enrons notice to the government of Maharashtra Mumbai should act pragmatically instead of indulging in heroics and rhetoric. It should set its own house in order improve MSEBs functioning and quickly privatise. If it fails to do these its threat to Enron will also be taken as just another case of demanding kickbacks. IT is sad really that Enron had to issue its pre-termination notice. We should now ask whether MSEB would be able to construct such a project in record time. Corruption is rampant in MSEB. They may say Enron power is not needed but you cannot even get a new connection easily. Interruptions are commonplace in rural areas (sometimes up to four times a week). Power thefts are commonplace too. Each day on average we pay MSEB about Rs 6 per unit for commercial connections. But most people would be willing to pay Rs 7 or so if they got clean uninterrupted power. We have seen for example the vast cost overruns of many of the official water management projects. These overruns go up to 20 times with delays stretching up to 10 years with no guarantee no results even then. All told the government is sending very wrong signals to the international community by raking up the Enron controversy. It should set its own house in order. THE new state ministries are too big in size West Bengals in particular. It has allotted one minister just to deal with fire brigades. The expenditure in lakhs it entails could exceed the total number of fire tenders under the department. Despite that it needed 7 complete days to control a recent fire (with private tankers requisitioned to help over and above the ones owned by the corporation and municipalities). We need more fire tenders not ministers or those who are associated with the big boss. Also we need a new minister plus a full-fledged department to examine corrupt practices in local government and also in the central government offices located in states. Meanwhile was the Sarkaria Commissions recommendation to restrict the size of the ministry to within 10 per cent of the size of the Assembly advanced only to be flouted? We should call a stop to such commissions as not even 10 per cent of their purpose is served they too entail huge establishments which are maintained year after year at taxpayer expense. SINCE 1993 I have been familiar with the political social and business scenarios in the US and so I feel reasonably qualified to make some observations on US immigration policy by Sudhir Shah. Shahs statistics are not totally accurate but they depict the `global picture. The Indian immigrants (a million plus now) are in many respects a class apart. Their education levels are far higher than those of other immigrants many of whom are just a grade above our rag-pickers (they are the cherry and berry pickers on US farms). I have not come across a single uneducated Indian in the US since 1983. Even in asset-formation Indians (even Pakistanis) are leagues ahead of the other immigrants.

The Godbole findings Our Editorial 05/22/2001 Business Standard 15 Copyright (c) Business Standard The Godbole committee's first report submitted on 10 April is an eye-opener to what can only be called a massive scandal. It leaves several players MSEB successive Maharashtra governments the Kirit Parikh re-negotiation exercise the Central Electricity Authority and other players in New Delhi with no clothes on. MSEB claimed that it had negotiated a tariff that was lower than would result from applying the central government's standard formula. But this was patently fraudulent because the comparison was based on wrong numbers incorrect technical parameters and unequal assumptions (one rupee-dollar rate for the Dabhol tariff another for calculating the government formula) all of it designed to establish what was not true. Asked in court why there had been no competitive bidding the answer (believe it or not) was that MSEB was not competent to handle competitive bidding. But it was so wonderfully capable of handling direct tariff negotiations that it eventually gave Dabhol a higher tariff than Enron had initially sought before the negotiations began! That's only for starters. There is much more in the Godbole report. On the basis of a passing comment in an FIPB meeting that the project's costs were broadly in line with other similar projects the power secretary in New Delhi tells the Central Electricity Authority that the CEA's techno-economic clearance is not required though this is statutorily mandated. The CEA agrees to this untenable proposition but later issues a vaguely worded clearance on the basis of a meeting whose minutes were not made available to the Godbole committee. The re-gasification project that was made part of the power project had a capacity to handle 5 million tonnes though Dabhol itself needed only 2.1 million tonnes. A port facility had similar excess capacity. Yet the entire cost of these facilities was loaded on to Dabhol along with the full cost of the 20-year gas supply contract. Thus as the Godbole committee observes what should have been a variable cost was converted to part of the fixed cost which MSEB would have to service through a capacity charge whether any power or gas was bought or not. Even the power requirements of Maharashtra were mis-calculated in order to over-ride a warning from the World Bank that the Dabhol power would not be needed. This was done by assuming that industrial demand for power would grow overnight at twice the earlier rate and that MSEB itself would overnight see a dramatic worsening of its operating parameters. There is still more in the report but the point should be obvious. What the report shows is that the Dabhol contract can be subjected to legal test (as in fact two members of the Godbole committee recommend) on the grounds that it was improperly handled and violative of law and common sense. If a favourable judicial decision becomes possible that should help mitigate the costs of winding up a truly scandalous project. For reasons that are not clear MSEB and the Maharashtra government have chosen not to go down this route. Perhaps they have greater and continuing faith in the re-negotiation process. Copyright  2000 Dow Jones & Company Inc. All Rights Reserved. SMARTMONEY.COM: Power Grab By Elizabeth Harris 05/21/2001 Dow Jones News Service (Copyright (c) 2001 Dow Jones & Company Inc.) NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Feeling squeezed by rising electricity bills and shrinking investment returns? Consider investing in utilities which posted solid gains amid the recent bear-market carnage. But plugging into this volatile sector is risky business as anyone who piled in this year based on energy's surge in 2000 can testify. After returning 7.28% last year as demand for power outstripped supply the average utilities fund is so far down 1% through May 18 according to the fund research firm Morningstar. Though the sector's prospects remain attractive such volatility is par for the course says Mark Beckwith portfolio manager of the Vanguard Utilities Income fund (VGSUX). Utilities and funds that focus on the sector no longer perform like bonds delivering most of the gains via relatively predictable dividend yields. Instead the industry has greater growth prospects (and the correspondingly higher potential for losses) tied to the fluctuating demand for power. Already high prices for natural gas and electricity have created incentives for producers to boost supplies. And the stodgy local monopolies that once dominated the industry must now reckon with a bevy of independent producers distributors and traders. Even telecom companies are now considered fair game offering managers of sector funds fresh choices alongside greater risk. The classification of a utility has changed Beckwith says. At the same time the crisis gripping electricity-starved California is showing other states the pitfalls to avoid as they deregulate their grids. The outlook for wiser deregulation is very much with us says Bill Reaves a manager of the Strong American Utilities fund (SAMUX). The crisis out west has also spurred construction of new power plants from New York to Florida he adds. Managers also count on continued political support from the former oilmen in the White House who are determined to boost domestic output. With such inducements in mind we screened Morningstar's database looking for no-load utilities portfolios with one-year returns of at least 1% and three-year annualized returns of 5% or more. We also sought funds with initial investment minimums no higher than $3000 and expense ratios below the category's average. Strong American Utilities Bill Reaves co-manager of the Strong American Utilities fund characterizes the $290 million portfolio's positions as real utilities. We try to concentrate in the electric and natural-gas area Reaves says. We try to concentrate in holdings and companies where we see good growth. Last year that meant scaling back significantly from telecom stocks in part because of a deteriorating outlook. Right now electric utilities represent 44.5% of the fund - and Dominion Resources (D) is the largest position. Energy ranging from gas utilities to integrated oil and gas companies has also been a significant holding at 24.2%. Reaves and the rest of the portfolio management team are also very sensitive to valuations. The portfolio consists of 40 stocks but the managers can devote up to 75% of the fund's assets to the 16 to 18 companies seen as the best bargains. This cautious approach has stood the fund well at a time when some of its competitors got hit by telecoms' travails. The Strong portfolio rose 27.33% in 2000 and is up 2.42% so far this year contributing to a 15.18% three-year record. Reaves expects the good times to last with industry earnings growth on the order of 8% to 10% coupled with dividends of about 5% over the next three to five years. Demand is likely to keep on being strong...and the value of the service is going to be appreciated a great deal more Reaves says. For example the electric utilities' average price-to-earnings ratio for 2002 is about 12 - roughly a 50% discount to the Standard & Poor's 500 index. The minimum investment is $2500 and the portfolio bears a 1% expense ratio. Vanguard Utilities Income We won't be moving with the Nasdaq says portfolio manager Beckwith of the Vanguard Utilities Income fund he runs. Beckwith invests a relatively small 17% slice of the $900 million fund in telecom stocks. As with the other funds in this screen such caution paid off last year when the fund gained 18.7%. That turned the tables on 1999 when the technology boom consigned Vanguard Utilities to the rear echelon of its peer group. Annualized over three years the portfolio has returned 9.33% trailing the average utilities' fund's 10.53%. Here too the emphasis is on attractive valuations. Beckwith also has a mandate to invest at least 95% of the portfolio in dividend-paying utilities (last year all assets had to be invested in such stocks.) I'm going to get as much growth as I can without taking on too much risk Beckwith says. Right now Beckwith has 61% of his assets in defensive electric utilities such as Dominion Resources or the FPL Group (FPL). The portfolio is down 2.65% so far this year but Beckwith too is counting on continued strong demand for electricity. Earnings momentum will be very good for the group at least over the next year he says. His main concern is that high energy prices could encourage conservation eventually depressing demand. The investment threshold is $3000 and the expense ratio is a slim 0.38%. American Gas Index fund This concentrated portfolio rises and falls with the gas industry's prospects. Strong natural-gas prices boosted the American Gas Index fund's (GASFX) return last year to a 55.86% far above the sector's average. That more than offset the 3.71% drop in 1999. Annualized over three years the roughly $300 million fund has gained 15.82%. Like other index portfolios the fund doesn't make stock picks instead it owns 73 members of the American Gas Association representing much of the gas distribution and transmission industry in most U.S. regions. Stocks are weighted by market-cap and by the portion of a company's assets involved in natural gas. Top holdings include Williams Companies (WMB) Enron (ENE) and Duke Energy (DUK). The initial investment is $2500 and expenses are 0.85%.

Malaysian LNG Sales to India Threatened by Enron Power Dispute 2001-05-22 06:32 (New York) Malaysian LNG Sales to India Threatened by Enron Power Dispute Kuala Lumpur May 22 (Bloomberg) -- Malaysia LNG Tiga Sdn. may have to find new buyers for as much as 2.6 million metric tons a year of liquefied natural gas if Dabhol Power Co. carries through termination of electricity supplies to India's Maharashtra State Electricity Board. MLNG Tiga has an agreement to deliver a maximum 2.6 million tons a year of LNG each year to an import terminal Enron is building to feed the Dabhol power plant. Saturday Dabhol Power 65 percent owned by Enron Corp. of the U.S. started a procedure to end its power supply contract to the electricity board its sole customer which owes over 3 billion Indian rupees ($64 million) in unpaid power bills. ``It is our hope that matters in India would be resolved'' said Azman Ibrahim spokesman for state-owned Petroliam Nasional Bhd. which owns 60 percent of MLNG Tiga. ``If they do not work out we would have to find or make alternative arrangements.'' MLNG Tiga is constructing Malaysia's third gas export facility which will raise the country's LNG capacity to 23 million tons from about 16 million tons in 2000. If Dabhol goes through with cancellation of its power supply contract MLNG Tiga would have to find buyers for more than a third of the 6.8 million tons it is adding to Malaysia's output capacity. Other partners in MLNG Tiga are the Sarawak state government with a 10 percent share Royal Dutch/Shell Group's unit Shell Gas BV with 15 percent Nippon Oil LNG (Netherlands) BV with 10 percent and Diamond Gas Netherlands BV with 5 percent. The plant is due to be completed at the end of 2002 with commercial production due to begin in 2003. India's federal and state governments may have to pay Dabhol Power Co. more than 170 billion rupees ($3.6 billion) if the Enron Corp. unit cancels its 2184 megawatt power venture. LEADER: India unplugged Financial Times May 22 2001 The latest threat from Enron the US energy group to pull out of its Dabhol power plant venture near Bombay illustrates both the shambolic nature of India's electricity system and the wider risks of investing in the country. The project had serious drawbacks. But unless energy companies can expect a commercial return they will not invest in badly needed new infrastructure. Unless contracts are honoured few foreign companies will consider India as a place to do business. The Maharashtra state electricity board the Dabhol plant's only customer is refusing to pay its bills arguing that the tariffs are unjustifiably inflated. Prices are certainly high. The plant fuelled by expensive naphtha is running way below capacity due to unexpectedly low demand further increasing unit costs. More difficult to judge is whether this is within the terms of the contract since Enron is keeping the details confidential. The argument over unit costs though is in any case less relevant than it might seem as most of India's state electricity boards including Maharashtra's operate at a large loss. Many consumers pay highly subsidised rates. Many pay nothing. Bills go uncollected. Half of Delhi's electricity output is stolen mostly to power middle-class air conditioners rather than light bulbs for the poor. Bankrupt state utilities are then periodically bailed out to the detriment of spending on health and education. India's state authorities urgently need to introduce a common minimum tariff and a more targeted form of subsidy. This may be unpopular but the central government's offer of Dollars 5.6bn raised via a bond issue to pay off the electricity boards' debts should sweeten the pill. A new pricing regime is only the first step. Electricity generation transmission and distribution should be unbundled and privatised. Contracts should be awarded through competition not by arrangement with the relevant political party. This would require much more transparency than many of India's politicians have been ready to concede. Enron's difficulties over the Dabhol plant the largest foreign investment in India have persuaded other western companies to withdraw from similar projects. This will hardly help the country to overcome the power shortages that hinder economic development. But the effect will reverberate well beyond the energy sector. India receives a pitifully small slice of the world's foreign direct investment. Infrastructure weaknesses are certainly one factor. But as important is the readiness of Indian politicians to manipulate foreign business for their own ends. Copyright: The Financial Times Limited May 22 2001 Houston Chronicle Enron pulls out of venture drilling in Qatar's waters By LAURA GOLDBERG Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle Enron Corp. is pulling out of a large natural gas project off Qatar the company said Monday. Plans for the Dolphin project called for Houston-based Enron to work with Elf a subsidiary of France's TotalFinaElf and the United Arab Emirates Offsets Group to develop and pipe natural gas from a block of the Qatar North Field. More than a year ago those involved with the project said it could end up requiring investments of up to $10 billion over six or seven years. Enron said Monday it was transferring its 24.5 percent stake in the project to the United Arab Emirates Offsets Group which said in a news release it had started negotiating with other international players to become stakeholders. With the transfer United Arab Emirates Offsets Group will own 75.5 percent of Dolphin. Terms of the deal weren't released. Enron pulled out for a couple reasons including that it believes there are better places to invest its money said Alex Parsons a company spokesman in London. The project doesn't necessarily fit with Enron's current focus. It is emphasizing businesses such as marketing and trading in wholesale markets such as those for natural gas electricity and broadband. Enron said it would consider future ventures with the United Arab Emirates Offsets Group that were in line with our core business activities. M. Carol Coale an energy analyst with Prudential Securities in Houston said Enron's move is consistent with its exit strategy from international assets that generate low returns. May 22 2001 Houston Chronicle Enron exploring commodity trading Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle News Services NEW YORK -- Houston-based Enron Corp. the nation's largest natural gas and electricity trading house is looking to continue its expansion into industries beyond energy with a move into the cocoa coffee and sugar businesses industry sources said Monday. Enron has had conversations and interviews with members of the commodity trade in recent weeks using a London-based recruitment firm to help them the sources said. They are definitely interested in getting into the business. Enron has been looking for physical traders. They have some internal people and are looking for lieutenants with experience a cocoa trader said. A representative of Enron's public relations department would only say that the firm is constantly investigating different markets and opportunities. There is always a lot of speculation about what we are doing Habiba Bayi of Enron said Monday.

976,,Vince I've been hearing rumors that Enron has decided to endorse the nodal pricing model as implemented in PJM. I just wanted to warn you that I'm not sure this is in Enron's long-term interest at all. Let me explain why. Feel free to give me a call if you'd like to talk more about this. First let me say that I firmly believe in locational pricing and specifically pricing congestion. However the way that PJM implements nodal pricing is to eliminate as much price volatility and reduce the transparency of the market. Specifically the PJM tariff gives the ISO the ability to mitigate to cost plus a %10 adder the bids of any market participant that the ISO deems is out of merit in one of the three zones in region. (The fact that a nodal market is talking about zones should give you cause for alarm.) Then the ISO takes this mitigated bid and re-runs its price-setting software to compute new nodal prices. The way I have (somewhat unfairly) decribed this price-setting process is that the PJM ISO decides what prices it would like for a given day and mitigates bids until it gets them. This is not a transparent market nor one where it makes any sense to buy the risk management services that Enron provides. The only price volatility you have to worry about in the PJM market is that kind that comes about if they need imports into their control area to meet demand. Under these circumstances you need to pay the imports whatever is necessary to get them to come to your market. However bear in mind FERC's desire to make a large RTO on the East Coast. This will effectively mean little imports to the East Coast RTO so all bids can be mitigated at the discretion of the ISO. Paying market-clearing prices to cost-of-service mitigated bids is just paying too much to eliminate price volatility. It effectively kills off the development of risk management at the wholesale and retail level. Power marketing becomes much less profitable because retailers know you can always buy at cost-mitigated prices. In short the PJM model is not market. It is just an alternative form of regulation that is politically attractive because it reduces price volatility but it is not good for consumers or traders because they just get a higher cost form of regulation than traditional cost-of-service regulation. You pay market-clearing prices to cost-of-service mitigated bids but under regulation you could just pay cost-of-service prices and eliminate the infra-marginal profits to low cost generators. As we discussed during our dinner I think the two biggest sources of benefits from re-structuring will come from getting the demand-side involved in the market and from more efficient risk management. A necessary condition for both of these to occur is prices that reflect actual conditions in the market (including the extent of market power exercised). Masking these signals dulls any incentive for market participants to make the investment necessary to management. The PJM model is just way to have a market in name without achieving any significant benefits to consumers or energy traders. Frank,"Energy; PJM; Nodal Pricing; Regulation

978,Comments On Draft RTO Letter On  Barton Proposal,Following up on last night's e-mail here are some specific suggestions to strengthen the draft EPSA letter on the Barton RTO draft. The second paragraph and the first few bullets after it should be rewritten as follows to make it clear that the current legislative proposal on RTOs is far off the mark as opposed to being fixed by technical corrections as the draft letter now states: You have identified RTOs as critical to the development of a well-functioning transmission system and we wholeheartedly agree. We commend you for including all transmission-owning utilities in the RTO provisions and for requiring that transmission be conducted on an open-access basis. However to accomplish the RTO and transmission goals we share it is essential that any legislation on RTOs not slow down the process already underway at FERC. Unfortunately the discussion draft as issued on October 9th does not meet this test. Specifically the proposal Establishes a lengthy and cumbersome process that will delay the formation of RTOs by imposing procedural requirements that advantage those who oppose properly functioning RTOs including evidentiary hearings and court appeals review under standards of judicial review not normally applicable to Federal Power Act cases. Removes the ability of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to deal with an evolving marketplace by statutorily freezing market and operational structures in place as of date of enactment regardless of changed circumstances. [rest of the bullets as in the draft letter] We appreciate the opportunity to offer these suggestions to strengthen the draft letter. Please call with any questions or comments before the Legislative Affairs Committee meeting tomorrow. Thanks. John,"Energy; Legislation; RTOs

979,Re: Stand-alone Reliability Legislation,I believe it is timely to discuss this again and I agree with Cynthia that stand alone legislation does nothing to address the essential transmission structural issues. I am open minded on the issue if someone can make a compelling case to support stand alone legislation BUT my gut reaction is that it would be a serious mistake. Congress would happily put off dealing with this issue for years if it passes reliability only legislation. I think the legislation itself makes little or no progress on our issues and may even set us back on making progress at FERC and in other fora. I realize that if this gets going it may be hard to stop but it would be such a cynically ineffective approach to the real reliability problems that we should help whomever we can to put a stop to it. If it gets through committee I have no confidence in this Congress to actually amend it into something better and broader so again I have difficulty seeing why we should go that route. I look forward to the discussion.

983,Senate Energy Hearing Today,The Senate Energy Committee held an oversight hearing today on siting impediments to energy infrastructure. The four witnesses were Jerry Halvorsen of INGAA William Nugent of Maine for NARUC David Cook general counsel of NERC and Stan Szwed vp-transmission of FirstEnergy Corp. The hearing was well attended by committee Republicans but only Sen. Bingaman and Sen. Landrieu on the Democratic side and then only briefly. Highlights NARUC's Nugent urged the Committee to move swiftly to confirm Wood and Brownell to FERC noting their confirmation hearing is tomorrow. Consensus that energy infrastructure is not able to keep up with projected energy demand both gas and electric. Surprising willingness (even among western Republican senators who are normally pro-states rights pro-private property rights) that Congress should at least seriously consider if not implement some form of federal authority over power transmission siting. Specifics were not nailed down with some senators expressing more support for treating electric like FERC already has power over natural gas while others were inclined more toward a FERC back stop or last resort authority when state decisionmaking breaks down. The drift was certainly toward some enhanced federal role. NERC released is Summer Assessment today that is more pessimistic than California ISO on the extent of expected rolling blackouts and shortages this summer. NERC seees a capacity shortage in the Pacific Northwest this winter. While NY/NE is adequate this summer Cook says it bears watching because of bouts of high heat in the region and a high level of unplanned outages that often occur in the region in the summer. Chairman Murkowski engaged in a series of questions with INGAA's Halvorsen designed to lay the blame for the natural gas capacity problem to California and corresponding high price levels on the actions of LDCs in California not supporting expansion of interstate pipelines. Halvorsen's testimony includes a chart of specific cases where LDCs intervened. In his verbal testimony Halvorsen singled out Sempra as a source of opposition including Sempra filings against expansions by Transwestern and Kern River. Chairman Murkowski got Halvorsen to say that the actions of the California LDCs and the intrastate nature of all gas pipelines in California effectively denied California consumers the benefit of open access for natural gas. Murkowski implied he would entertain a change in the Natural Gas Act as it relates to the status of interstate pipelines going in to California. Sen. Domenici joined the increasing chorus of members of Congress raising questions about why natural gas prices are low at the wellhead for his producers in New Mexico but so high into California. He asked the panel who is making the money in the differential but none of the witnesses wanted to tackle the question. This is just one more indication of the growing interest in the natural gas aspects of the California situation.,"Energy; Senate; Hearing; Infrastructure; FERC; NARUC; NERC; Natural Gas; California

Jeff Jeffrey Keeler Director Environmental Strategies Enron Washington DC office - (202) 466-9157 Cell Phone (203) 464-1541 Rob Bradley 03/23/2001 10:14 AM To: Jeffrey Keeler/Corp/Enron cc: Michael Terraso/OTS/Enron@ENRON Steven J Kean/NA/Enron@Enron Lauren Iannarone/NY/ECT@ECT Ann M Schmidt/Corp/Enron@ENRON Subject: Ken Lay Statement to Employees on Bush CO2 Policy (KEELER EDITS) Here is my draft for Ken in response to Ann's eBiz request. Comments welcome The President after a good deal of study and soul searching decided not to support mandatory controls on carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from power plants as part of a multipollutant clean air strategy. His decision was based on some very important factors -- the nation's energy markets are experiencing unprecedented supply and price challenges that any CO2 mandate could exacerbate and U.S. regulation of CO2 in the near-term could be ill-advised because the Kyoto protocol on global treatment of greenhouse gas emissions is unworkable in its current form. I was somewhat concerned that the message sent by the Bush administration would polarize the debate over how the U.S. should treat CO2 emissions in the long term as his statement did provoke a very negative anti-environment reaction by many concerned individuals and organizations. Because this is an important issue to all parties on all sides of the debate I believe that the administration should convene an ongoing process to carefully examine global climate change and all the long-term economic scientific and social impacts of action regulate CO2 emissions. The President's position on CO2 notwithstanding Enron continue to be a private sector leader in offering real solutions towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions in a rapidly expanding energy market. We are well-positioned through our experience with low-carbon fuels for electric generation (natural gas and wind in particular) our focus on new power generation and tecnologies our leadership position in promoting efficiency through Enron Energy Services' energy outsourcing business and our expertise in emissions trading and risk management. A multipollutant appraoch to reducing power plant emissions makes a lot of sense from and environmental and energy policy standpoint. Enron will continue to work with the Bush administration and Congress toward structuring a program that can achieve environmental goals while providing incentives to build cleaner more efficient generation promoting a broad mix of fuels and tecnologies and giving industry the flexibility and economic incentives to make reductions in a market-based cost-effective way. If we're able to make meaningful reductions in 3 pollutants -- NOx SO2 and mercury -- and we do it in a way that promotes efficiency and new technology we'll make progress on CO2 whether it is regulated or not. In the meantime I will remain active in the global climate change debate to position Enron as a constructive player in the public policy arena and as an industry leader in promoting market-driven solutions to the world's energy and environmental problems. ,"Energy; California; Power Crisis

Rhapsodic Lawmakers Legislature: Speaking frankly officials have used the wiener as an easily digestible metaphor for the state's energy crisis. BYLINE: JULIE TAMAKI MIGUEL BUSTILLO TIMES STAFF WRITERS DATELINE: SACRAMENTO BODY: ??Every crisis has its symbol. ??Watergate had Deep Throat. The S&L scandal had Charles Keating. O.J. did--or didn't--have a bloody glove. ??Here in the Capitol the hot dog has become an unlikely metaphor for the state's energy crisis. ??In packed news conferences and heated Assembly floor debates lawmakers from both parties have evoked images of the ordinary dog to help explain an extraordinary mess. ??The genesis of this statehouse trend is difficult to determine. Assemblyman Fred Keeley appears to be the first to have tossed the hot dog into the political fire. ??During a crucial Assembly discussion in January the Boulder Creek Democrat recited the lyrics to a familiar Oscar Mayer jingle as a way of admitting that a controversial bill to have the state buy electricity to avoid blackouts was unpalatable but necessary. ??It's the dog kids love to bite said Keeley of the jingle. Well this is the bill people love to hate. ??A bizarre partisan hot dog duel ensued. Assemblyman John Campbell (R-Irvine) responded by likening the unpredictable financial consequences of the Keeley legislation to biting recklessly into mystery meat. ??Before I bite into it I see what's on the outside but I can't see the inside Campbell said. If nobody can tell me what's on the inside it may be bitter it may be bad it may make me sick. ??Assemblywoman Carole Migden (D-San Francisco) angrily fired back wanting to know why Campbell a professed hot dog eater was suddenly so critical of its unknown contents. ??It's OK to eat a hot dog that's full of animal bones and hair Migden said. That's a hot dog that's OK with you but this kind of hot dog isn't. ??Yet it was Senate leader John Burton who made it the key ingredient in a Capitol catch phrase. ??Burton described a plan to purchase the electrical power grid from the state's private utilities as a fair swap saying: I give you a dollar you give me a hot dog. ??The sound-bite quickly took on a life of its own. With the cost of the energy crisis growing faster than the price of ballpark franks critics doubted the public's appetite for a multibillion-dollar hot dog. ??Do you really want a hot dog? That is the question said Jan Smutny-Jones executive director of the Independent Energy Producers a trade group for power generators. ??Not content to let a dog lie in its bun lawmakers such as Assemblyman Bill Leonard (R-San Bernardino) kept the hot dog in public discourse. ??When Pacific Gas & Electric Co. filed for bankruptcy protection Leonard was one of a chorus of legislators who questioned the merits of purchasing the remaining portion of the power lines calling it not even half a hot dog. ??Added Assemblyman Bill Campbell (R-Villa Park): It's like paying Mercedes prices for a broken down hot dog cart. ??In recent weeks the hot dog rhetoric appeared to have gone cold. Then Assemblyman Juan Vargas (D-San Diego) revived it. ??After enduring hours of testimony on details of the deal to purchase Edison's power lines Vargas said his opinion of the dollar-equals-hot-dog deal had diminished. ??They're trying to charge us for a hot dog Vargas said of the utility but it looks like we're only going to be getting a wienie. ??Reliant Vice President John Stout also recently weighed in with his own hot dog analogy as he tried to explain why his company's income had jumped so much during the crisis. ??If you have a hot dog stand and you go out and buy five to six more hot dog stands Stout said referring to his company's purchase of power plants then naturally you would expect the operating income to go up. ??Alas the dog days of summer have yet to begin.

A1 LENGTH: 835 words HEADLINE: Davis asks U.S. to limit firms' prices RATE SWINGS: Governor argues 2 generators manipulated market SOURCE: Chronicle Sacramento Bureau BYLINE: Lynda Gledhill DATELINE: Sacramento BODY: Gov. Gray Davis pursued a new strategy yesterday to control wholesale electricity costs by demanding that federal regulators ban two generators from selling power in California at market rates arguing that they have manipulated the market to their advantage. ???Meanwhile the Davis administration lambasted a federal plan to implement temporary price controls scheduled to go into effect Tuesday. State officials said the measures would do nothing to tame California's out-of-control costs for electricity. ???Davis whose calls for broader price limits on wholesale electricity have been rejected repeatedly by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is scheduled to meet with President Bush next week to ask Washington to do more to help California. ???Federal regulators said that prices were 'unjust and unreasonable' nearly nine months ago but they have been AWOL ever since Davis said in a statement. ???The California Independent System Operator managers of the state's electrical grid asked energy regulators yesterday to revoke the authority they have given Williams Energy and AES Inc. to sell power at market-based rates. Instead the Davis administration wants the companies to be forced to sell at cost-plus rates which would ensure a reasonable but limited profit. ???Market-based rate authority is not an entitlement the ISO said in a filing with federal regulators. ???The ISO asked regulators to act by June 15 saying that any delay places California consumers and the state's economy at extreme peril. ???Similar filings against other companies such as Mirant Duke and Reliant are being considered said Charles Robinson general counsel for the ISO. ???Robinson said the ISO has a well developed record of price manipulation by the two companies. He said information previously given to federal regulators proved the prices charged to California were excessive. ???'GRANDSTANDING' ACCUSATION ???Aaron Thomas a spokesman for Virginia-based AES said the administration is grandstanding. ???This is akin to the rhetoric the governor has used for the past several months he said. We are well below the index FERC uses to establish concerns about market power. ???As to this rhetoric about these companies abusing the marketplace -- check the facts. We lost money last year Thomas said. ???A spokeswoman for Williams said the company would not comment because it had not seen the filing. ???Earlier this month Oklahoma-based Williams agreed to pay $8 million to settle charges with FERC that the company was purposely withholding electricity from California's power market. The company admitted no wrongdoing and officials said a full hearing would have cleared the company. ???If the regulatory commission denies the state's requests or doesn't act in the time frame we believe is necessary to prevent harm the state can appeal to a circuit court Robinson said. ???BUSH VISIT POSTURING CHARGE ???Jan Smutny-Jones head of the Independent Energy Producers Association said the move is posturing by Davis ahead of Bush's visit. ???This is an interesting welcome mat for President Bush he said. Do we want a dialogue or a diatribe? ???In advance of Bush's visit Vice President Dick Cheney said yesterday that nothing more can be done to help solve California's power problems this summer. ???He also rejected price controls saying that previous efforts have contributed to a supply shortage. ???A spokesman for Davis rejected that notion and denied that the timing of yesterday's announcements were connected to the Bush-Davis meeting. ???Davis aides expressed hope that Bush's two new FERC commissioners Pat Wood III a close Bush ally expected to take over the chairmanship of the board and Nora Mead Brownell a state utility regulator in Pennsylvania would hear California's pleas. The two new commissioners were confirmed yesterday by the U.S. Senate. ???Among the things Davis wants changed is the regulatory commission temporary price relief plan scheduled to take effect Tuesday. ???The regulators would limit wholesale prices during power alerts in California when reserves drop below 7 percent of available capacity. ???Many state officials believe that doesn't go far enough. The state Assembly in documents to be filed Tuesday said price controls should cover all hours -- not just power emergencies. ???And there is a chance the controls will be in effect for just a few days. Under the regulatory commission plan the state and the three investor-owned utilities must file a proposal to join a regional transmission organization by June 1. If they do not to do so the price controls disappear. ???Davis administration officials expect to file another response dealing with the regional transmission organization by Friday Robinson said. The Assembly filing rejects joining such an organization which federal officials favor as a means to better manage and improve grid capacity in the West.

EMSHWILLER Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL On the eve of a meeting Tuesday between President George Bush and California Gov. Gray Davis top advisers to the governor said the state could be pushed into recession unless the federal government imposes temporary price caps to contain soaring wholesale electricity costs. President Bush has consistently opposed price caps. The governor's team called a Memorial Day news conference to highlight what they saw as the dangers to the economy of the state and possibly the nation from the tens of billions of dollars being spent this year to purchase electricity. The governor's aides estimated that statewide wholesale electricity purchases this year could hit $50 billion compared with about $7 billion in 1999. Some estimates for this year's power expenditures are even higher. If California were a separate nation an energy shock of that magnitude would be expected to cause a significant recession said Alan Blinder a former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve at the conference. While being part of a broader national economy could somewhat mitigate the impact the higher power costs are a recipe for stagflation in California added Mr. Blinder. Stagflation refers to stagnant economic conditions and inflation -- a condition that struck the nation when energy prices soared in the 1970s. Though the advisers painted perhaps the dreariest outlook yet to come from the governor's office they said that the Davis plan for financing the state's electricity purchases remains intact. As reported the state plans to sell about $12.5 billion in bonds later this year. The state has been purchasing electricity since January when its failed utility-deregulation plan left California's two biggest utilities financially unable to continue buying power. If price caps were instituted the state might have to borrow less money than anticipated or at least face a decreased danger of having to borrow more if the power situation gets worse said Joseph Fichera chief executive of New York-based Saber Partners LLC and an adviser to Mr. Davis. The governor plans to press his case for price caps over the next six to 18 months as supplies are increased with new power plants due to come into operation the advisers said. However Mr. Bush and other federal officials have repeatedly said that they believe price caps would be counterproductive and discourage the building of new power plants. Write to John R.

Robert Hillman BODY: ??LOS ANGELES _ President Bush landed in hostile territory Monday night beginning his first presidential visit to California amid a pressing energy crisis that he says he cannot ease in the short term. ??We welcome him to California said California Gov. Gray Davis a Democrat who has waged a long-distance war with the Republican president over the high cost and short supply of electricity in the nation's most populous state. ??I hope he has an opportunity to talk firsthand to some of the people who are adversely impacted by the very high rates we're paying for electricity. ??But the president's carefully scrubbed schedule for the next two days provides little time for such an opportunity although he will confer privately with business leaders to discuss high-tech solutions to the state's energy problems. ??Arriving on a cross-country flight that touched down in Arizona for a Memorial Day tribute Bush headed off to prepare for an early-morning stop Tuesday to promote energy conservation at the Marine Corps' Camp Pendleton and a luncheon address to the Los Angeles World Affairs Council. ??On Wednesday he'll visit Sequoia National Park near Fresno Calif. to launch a new drive to clean up and fix up national parks. ??He'll also meet privately Tuesday afternoon with Davis in what the Los Angeles Times characterized as a peace summit. But no major shifts in policy are expected. White House aides suggest that the meeting will be a success if the governor even temporarily tempers his sometimes-harsh words for the administration. ??The president's focus is going to be on solving problems. He's not interested in finger-pointing White House press secretary Ari Fleischer said. ??Whether people agree or disagree with the specifics of his energy plan I think most Americans and most Californians are very pleased to see a president who is leading and taking action in addressing the issue head on. ??However recent public opinion polls show the president and the governor taking hits for the energy crisis in California. ??The Field Poll finished a week ago found that 54 percent of those surveyed believed Bush had handled the energy problems poorly with Davis faring somewhat better at 38 percent. The margin of error for the 1015 California interviews was 3.2 percentage points. ??An earlier survey by the Public Policy Institute of California found Davis' job approval rating plummeting from 63 percent in January to 46 percent in May as the state's energy troubles escalated. Bush's overall approval rating was higher at 57 percent but still just as many of those surveyed gave him low marks for his handling of energy issues. That margin of error for 2001 interviews was 2 percentage points. ??In short political analyst Sherry Bebitch Jeffe said Bush's visit to the state _ in his 19th week as president after already visiting more than half the other states _ is long overdue. ??His not responding or not being perceived to respond to the short-term needs of California has allowed Davis' arguments to resonate _ that the federal government is uncaring is insensitive Jeffe said. ??In his national energy policy unveiled nearly two weeks ago Bush offered a series of mostly long-term recommendations to conserve energy find more of it and substantially upgrade and expand the nation's oil refineries and transmission systems for natural gas and electricity. ??Davis complaining that Texas energy companies in particular are gouging Californians has urged Bush to embrace price controls for wholesale electricity but the president has steadfastly refused. Vice President Dick Cheney who oversaw development of the White House energy policy emphasized as recently as Friday that there's no quick fix on the way for California. ??Long term the answer is to build more power plants and that's exactly what they're doing Cheney told the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. But they're not going to have enough new capacity online this summer to avoid blackouts. ??So the energy woes continue to fester in California. It's not just electricity and rolling blackouts. Gasoline prices of $2-and-more-a-gallon have become commonplace as well. ??The gas bothers me more than the electric said Tait Kmentt who runs a legal process serving business in Irvine Calif. Gas prices are killing me. ??At $2.25-a-gallon for premium gasoline he says it costs him more than $40 to fill up his new Mercedes _ with no relief in sight. ??A newcomer to the state Kmentt voted for Bush last fall and said he's glad the president is finally visiting California. But Kmentt cautioned This will be a big test to see how concerned he is. ??Kmentt said he understands the state's energy troubles are a huge problem that can't be fixed overnight and right now he's blaming the power companies for the high price of electricity. ??I just think the public is being lied to he said. ??Still this is not good news for Bush who has been increasingly portrayed by Democrats as a Texas oilman still beholden to the industry. California which he lost last fall to Al Gore by 12 percentage points has become increasingly a political headache. ??Where his predecessor Bill Clinton seemed politically and personally comfortable Bush is not suggests Jeffe a senior scholar in the School of Policy Planning and Development at the University of Southern California. ??An ego cannot be buoyed by losing the state by 12 points she said. We are the state that was responsible for giving Al Gore his popular vote victory. ??With the Senate now headed for Democratic control Jeffe said Bush's visit to California _ and others that will surely follow _ are essential to help Republicans hold their base in the House. ??If the energy crisis persists in California further punishing its economy the ripple effects will certainly spread she said. ??George Bush remembers the influence of the economy on the career of an incumbent president Jeffe said pointing to Bush's father who was defeated by Clinton during an economic slump in 1992. ??It took a while she said but people are beginning to get angry. ??(c) 2001 The Dallas Morning News. ??Visit The Dallas Morning News on the World Wide Web at http://www.dallasnews.com/ JOURNAL-CODE: DA LOAD-DATE: May 29 2001 of 98 DOCUMENTS 2001 / Los Angeles Times Angeles Times ??????????????????????May 29 2001 Tuesday ?Home Edition SECTION: California Part 2 Page 1 Metro Desk LENGTH: 1178 words HEADLINE: Governor to Stress Price Caps to Bush Power: In a meeting today with the president Davis will present a letter from economists backing cost controls and demand federal assistance. BYLINE: DAN MORAIN JAMES GERSTENZANG TIMES STAFF WRITERS BODY: ??Gov. Gray Davis will present a letter to President Bush today from top economists advocating wholesale electricity price controls warning Monday that a failure by Bush to help California solve its energy crisis could signal to other regions that he may ignore their pleas. ??Bush making his first trip to California has set aside 20 minutes this afternoon to meet with Davis in Century City. In an interview with The Times the Democratic governor vowed to repeat his request that the federal government move to cap wholesale power prices. Failure to act swiftly threatens the state and national economy Davis said. ??I want him to understand Davis said that if California has to pay 700 times more for electricity in 2001 than it did just two years ago it could well drag our economy into a recession and could conceivably trigger a national recession. That is not good for anyone. ??In the letter 10 economists including Cornell professor emeritus Alfred Kahn a major proponent of airline deregulation told of their deep concern about the failure of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to stabilize wholesale electricity prices in California. The economists faxed the letter to the White House on Friday afternoon and provided the governor with a copy to present to Bush today. ??FERC's failure to act now will have dire consequences for the state of California and will set back potentially fatally the diffusion of competitive electricity markets across the country the economists led by Frank Wolak of Stanford University wrote. Moreover this negative experience with electricity restructuring could delay or reverse current efforts to introduce competition into other formerly regulated industries. ??Davis called the letter very significant validation of what we've been saying: The marketplace is not working and FERC has an obligation to act. ??We're not pleading for relief we're entitled to it Davis said. ??Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney repeatedly have said such controls never work. In California caps might worsen the situation by limiting supply they have argued resulting in more blackouts this summer when demand for electricity is highest. ??The Bush-Davis meeting has had all the buildup of the political equivalent of a title fight: On one side the Democratic governor of the nation's most populous state which Bush lost by more than 1 million votes in November. On the other the new president coming off a roller coaster week of political defeat (the shift in control of the Senate) and victory (passage of his tax-cut plan) whose work in the Texas oil industry gives him a special history in the topic at hand. ??From afar Davis has battled the Bush administration's energy policy. But said Dan Bartlett one of the president's chief communications advisors The president has some interesting views on this topic as well with some experience himself. ??Bush's Energy secretary Spencer Abraham took steps Monday to increase electricity transmission capacity in California. He ordered the Western Area Power Administration a division of the Energy Department that is responsible for marketing electricity from federal water projects in 15 Western states to finish its planning for extra transmission capacity. ??At issue is so-called Path 15 an 84-mile stretch of power lines with insufficient capacity to carry the necessary load between Southern California and the northern part of the state especially during peak hours. The central question is whether financing is available for a new transmission line. ??Davis lauded the action but said the president needs to do more. ??If I have any advice to him of a political nature it is take a chapter out of President Clinton's book. ?? [Clinton] was very attentive to California and as a result did better in 1996 than he did in '92. People felt he was here for us when we needed help. We need help. ??Davis said that on a recent trip to Chicago officials there worried that if Bush won't offer California some relief he may not offer us relief in a catastrophe. ??Among the facts and figures Davis intends to show the president is a chart showing that California paid $1.2 billion for electricity in the first quarter of 1999 $1.8 billion for the same period last year and as much as $10.3 billion for electricity in the first three months of this year--at a time when conservation efforts had been taking hold and demand was down. ??I hope the president will be as stunned as I am said Davis who is watching as the state spends more than $55 million a day to buy electricity that private utilities can no longer afford. ??Davis said that though he is trying to speed construction of power plants encourage conservation and return the private utilities to financial stability the federal government has control over wholesale power prices. ??Therein lies the final piece of this puzzle Davis said. If it falls into place we're on the way to putting this issue behind us. If it doesn't fall into place it could create real economic havoc here and across the country. ??Davis said that if Bush refuses to impose price controls he should find some way to help us consistent with his own belief. ??Turning a deaf ear not only won't be well received here Davis said. It likely won't be received well elsewhere. ??The state's energy crisis has posed a ticklish dilemma for Bush's busy travel schedulers: Had he visited earlier it would have been awkward not to focus on energy issues. But until 11 days ago when a task force led by Cheney produced energy proposals there would have been little Bush could say. ??Karen Hughes the president's counselor made it clear that regardless of the pressure Bush will not yield on price caps. ??We want to help. The president is very concerned about the energy situation and blackouts she said. But limiting the wholesale price of energy would only discourage its production Hughes said. ??California is the 30th state Bush has visited since taking office Jan. 20. His staff said the delay had to do not with energy issues but with politics and geography. ??With the administration focused in its first months on winning approval of the tax cut the president's travels were largely dictated by that effort his aides said. ??Besides the president confided recently even with Air Force One at the ready it just takes too long to fly from Washington to California. ??Still Hughes said the president is not ignoring California. Condoleezza Rice the president's national security advisor and a former Californian sits next to Hughes every morning at the daily meeting of the White House senior staff she said. ??What's more the president has many friends in California Hughes said adding: Ernie has a home in California these days. Ernie is the Bush family cat that is living with a friend in Brentwood while the First Family lives in the White House. ??* ??Times Staff Writer Massie Ritsch contributed to this story.

BYLINE: MITCHELL LANDSBERG TIMES STAFF WRITER DATELINE: McKITTRICK Calif. BODY: ??You could think of this as California's own little slice of west Texas. ??Here in the scruffy brown hills of western Kern County oil rigs grow more easily than trees pickups are more common than cars and chicken fried steak is the most popular dish at Mike and Annie's McKittrick Hotel. ??The hotel--which no longer offers lodging just food and drink and plenty of it--is bustling these days with the roustabout energy of a Lone Star construction camp. Just down the road a mammoth electrical power plant is rising out of the sagebrush its generators housed in four boxy buildings the size of airplane hangars. ??It is one of six new major gas-fired power plants expected to be built in Kern County over the next several years an electrical construction boom unmatched anywhere in California. Kern which already has a large surplus of electricity is cementing its place as California's energy capital assuming far more than its share of the burden in recharging the state's drained power supplies. ??Over the next several years the county will add nearly 5000 megawatts of power to the statewide grid. That is more than California now imports on average from out-of-state suppliers. It's enough to supply about five counties the size of Kern which fills the dusty southern rim of the San Joaquin Valley and has a population of 662000. ??In some parts of the state a proposal to build a new power plant is a call to throw up the barricades. In recent months intense community opposition has forced developers to pull back proposals to build major plants in South Gate and San Jose although Gov. Gray Davis has tried to revive plans for the San Jose plant. ??You don't hear a lot of not-in-my-backyard talk in Kern County. ??There should be power plants in everybody's backyard said Paul Gipe chairman of the Kern chapter of the Sierra Club which did not oppose any of the new plants. If people are concerned about having too many power plants they should think twice when they flip on the light switch. ??New natural gas-fired power plants Gipe reasoned are relatively clean and will not add significantly to the county's serious air pollution problems. Ideally he said they will allow the state to close some older dirtier plants that cause considerably more environmental damage. ??If environmentalists don't oppose the plants it's not too much of a leap to guess that some people might be positively thrilled about them. ??Just try for instance asking somebody in Taft an oil center south of McKittrick. It's more money coming into Kern County--that's the way I look at it said Pamela Dunlap who runs a downtown thrift shop. ??An Economy Rooted in the Oil Industry ??She stood in the twilight outside her shop on a street that embodies many of the most attractive attributes of small town Americana--with one small difference. Where some towns might have statues of their founders or war heroes in prominent public places Taft has erected small oil rigs and other pieces of drilling machinery a reminder of its economic roots. ??That Kern County has stepped up as California's blackout-buster is perhaps not surprising. ??To begin with there's geography. Kern stands astride California's major north-south electrical transmission lines at precisely the spot at which they divide between the service areas of Pacific Gas & Electric which serves Northern California and Southern California Edison. That spot can be pinpointed as the Midway substation a vast jungle of humming wires transformers and circuit breakers that lies a short distance west of Interstate 5 in the town of Buttonwillow. ??Already massive new circuit-breakers--they look like Frankenstein helmets sprouting 5-foot-long sparkplugs--are being erected at Midway to handle the power from two major plants that will be revving up in the coming months: PG&E National Energy's La Paloma plant the one near McKittrick and Edison Mission Energy's Sunrise plant just south of Taft. ??The county is served by two major natural gas pipelines which will be tapped to run the plants. In fact Kern contains the state's largest known reservoirs of natural gas. ??Another of Kern's geographic advantages? ??You look around and you'll see there aren't a lot of people living around here observed Stephen Whaley who is overseeing construction of the Sunrise plant. In the surrounding hills an orchard of oil rigs bobbed in the morning haze. Dirt roads cut crudely across the landscape bisecting a crisscross of steam pipes fuel lines and electrical wires. ??This area is all about oil Whaley said. Casting a glance at the modular 560-megawatt plant rising behind him he added with a wry smile You know I guess you could look at this from the road and you could make the argument that it improves the looks. ??The Sunrise plant a relatively simple single-cycle plant is expected to fire up 320 megawatts of its total output by Aug. 1 a scant nine months after construction began. The other plants--more complex and efficient dual-cycle operations--will be opening over the next several years assuming all receive final approval. ??The lack of major opposition to the plants is of course another reason developers see Kern County as a good place to build. The county has long had a more intimate relationship with energy--oil gas electricity--than most places. To people here the link between a natural gas well and a lightbulb or an oil derrick and a gas pedal is neither theoretical nor especially threatening. They're comfortable with energy. ??Kern produces more crude oil than any other county in the United States outside Alaska. Property taxes from oil companies have helped build handsome new schools in Bakersfield the county seat and largest city. The companies' big payrolls have helped populate elegant subdivisions with names that sound vaguely Houstonian: Seven Oaks River Oaks Landmark Estates. ??Which brings us to the Texas connection. ??It's hard to overlook it in a county that runs on oil and cotton and boasts a country music scene to rival Austin's. Conversations in the finer Bakersfield restaurants are filled with references to trips to Texas of colleagues in Midland and Odessa. A Bakersfield radio station was running a contest recently: The winners would be flown to a bull riding championship in Houston. ??Until December 1999 American Airlines offered direct jet service between Bakersfield and Dallas. It stopped after Occidental Petroleum moved its headquarters from Bakersfield to Houston. ??This is a county where President Bush received more support in the November election than he did in Texas his home state. But then Bush already had a Bakersfield connection: He lived there briefly as a child when his father former President George Bush worked in the Kern oil fields. ??You look at the topography around Bakersfield and the county's morals and ethics--that predominantly conservative attitude that we have around here--and you look at the oil and you could be in Midland said John Allen the general manager of Occidental of Elk Hills which is developing a power plant in tandem with Sempra Energy of San Diego. ??A lot of people in Kern County will tell you they don't mind being an energy farm for the state. It's a living after all. ??It's good to be working at home said Joe Ryan a Bakersfield pipe welder who has spent years on the road seeking the heavy construction work that seemed to have vanished in his hometown. Now he's working at the La Paloma plant a 1048-megawatt behemoth that will come online in phases beginning in December. ??About 800 people are at work on the plant and several hundred more will be employed in the coming months. And after that plant is done there will be others to build. ??This is a good job here I tell you what said Ryan 47 who has been banking his overtime on six 10-hour days a week--sometimes more. ??County Sees Itself as 'Part of the Solution' ??But there are some signs of simmering resentment especially among county leadership. After all if every other county produced just half the electricity that Kern generates California wouldn't have an energy crisis. And people in Kern County are getting hit with the same spring-loaded electricity bills the same rolling blackouts as everybody else. ??I think the people of California are either going to be part of the solution or part of the problem said Assemblyman Roy Ashburn (R-Bakersfield). And in Kern County we have a long history of being part of the solution especially when it comes to energy issues. ??Elsewhere in the state Ashburn sees a lot of arrogance--people who enjoy the benefits of a very high quality of life enjoy the benefits of electric power for jobs and for their personal life but with an exclusivity that it's someone else's problem to create that for them. We don't have that attitude in Kern County. ??Power Buildup in Kern County ??Six new major gas-fired power plants are expected to be built in Kern County over the next several years making the county the power capital of the state. ??* ??RELATED STORY ??Letter to Bush: Gov.

SANGER DATELINE: LOS ANGELES May 28 BODY: ??Days after he suffered the biggest political setback of his four-month-old presidency and then won the tax cut that he staked his campaign upon President Bush traveled tonight to California carefully calibrating how to deal with the state's energy crisis. ??After Memorial Day celebrations in Washington and Mesa Ariz. Mr. Bush began his first visit as president to the most populous state which he lost by roughly 12 percentage points in November's election. The visit seems likely to showcase the clash between two very different energy strategies and political strategies. ???Mr. Bush will meet briefly on Tuesday with Gov. Gray Davis who will insist as he did again today that the federal government impose price caps on wholesale electric power. ??The White House says Mr. Bush will refuse again. He will argue that such caps would only discourage increased production of electric power. We think that's a mistake Vice President Dick Cheney said on Friday talking about why he rejected those options when he prepared the energy policy the administration made public 10 days ago. ??But Mr. Bush knows that how he handles the California energy crisis could prove critical to his political fortunes especially now that his party's loss of control in the Senate seems bound to slow or derail passage of major elements of his energy plan. ??Moreover the president can no longer argue that the best cure for high energy prices is a tax cut because that is now legislative history. As one of his aides said this weekend after Congress approved the $1.35 trillion tax cut that will be phased in over the next 10 years we will have to turn now to the other arguments. ??Most of those arguments involve urging the rest of the country not to follow California in a partial deregulation of the market with disastrous results. ??Repeatedly Mr. Bush has chastised California's politicians and by implication Mr. Davis himself for ignoring politically unpalatable choices to avert the state's power-generating crisis. Ten days ago standing in front of a hydroelectric plant in Pennsylvania Mr. Bush used the state as Exhibit A for his argument about what happens when population rises when over-regulation freezes the construction of new power plants and the stringing of new transmission lines and when politicians fail to plan for the long term. ??The problems in California shows that you cannot conserve your way to energy independence Mr. Bush said then. ??At the same time his aides were pointing to polls showing Mr. Davis's approval ratings plunging. They did not mention that Mr. Bush's ratings in the state were hardly any better. A series of recent polls show that roughly two-thirds of Californians believe Mr. Bush should be doing far more to help the state though it is unclear exactly what kind of help they have in mind. ??So Mr. Bush's aides have been struggling for days to choreograph the two-day visit here trying to find ways to differ with Mr. Davis without seeming callous about the problem or in conflict with the state. ??The betting is that Mr. Bush will focus on long-term solutions in contrast to Mr. Davis's call for the quicker fix of price caps. ??The effort started today. Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham issued an order of chiefly symbolic importance saying his department would move quickly to determine whether investors were interested in financing and co-owning a new transmission line that could bring more power to the state. ??The level of interest will be a factor in the decision to build the line later this year the Energy Department said. It said that it would proceed with studies of how the land could be acquired by eminent domain if necessary and that it would speed ahead with environmental reviews. ??But Mr. Abraham left wide open the question of whether Washington would go ahead with the project even if no private financing was available. ??The Bush administration is taking a leadership role in addressing a long-neglected problem in California's electricity transmission system Mr. Abraham said. California's electricity problems developed over a period of years and cannot be solved overnight. However we can move now on actions that will help avert the same types of problems from recurring year after year. ??The statement was clearly intended as a prelude to the meeting with Mr. Davis which will be closed to the press. So will a meeting with energy entrepreneurs. (Mr. Bush passed on Mr. Davis's suggestion of a forum with small-business owners and residents who have seen the lights go out.) ??Few expect Mr. Bush or Mr. Davis to change his mind about energy caps after their meeting. ??But for Mr. Bush it will not all be tough love. On Tuesday morning Mr. Bush is scheduled to travel to Camp Pendleton to repeat his call for the military and other federal users of power in California to flip off their switches whenever possible. But given his own comments and Mr. Cheney's about the limited utility of conservation that order could strike some Californians as a little hollow. ??Later he will give a trade speech in Los Angeles underscoring the message that if California hopes to remain the world's greatest exporter of high technology -- if it were a nation California would be the world's sixth-largest economy -- it must find new ways to produce and deliver electricity. ??Already leading Silicon Valley companies are threatening to build their next-generation chip fabrication plants elsewhere probably in Texas which has a surplus of generating capacity a move that would further undermine Mr. Davis's stewardship. ??In fact Mr. Bush's Texas roots will never be far from the political battlefield here. Mr. Davis has accused Texas energy companies of profiteering at California's expense. To press the case he has hired two political operatives from the Clinton White House Marc D. Fabiani and Chris Lehane who are being paid tens of thousands of dollars a month to make the case for price caps. ??California's attorney general Bill Lockyer also a Democrat suggested to The Wall Street Journal last week that some time in jail would be the best way to deal with one of Mr. Bush's biggest supporters -- Kenneth Lay who heads the Enron Corporation and has sought to influence the selection of members of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. ??The comments may have been partly facetious but they were not interpreted that way here. ??http://www.nytimes.com LOAD-DATE: May 29 2001 of 98 DOCUMENTS ??????????????Copyright 2001 Knight Ridder/Tribune News Service ???????????????????????Knight Ridder/Tribune News Service ??????????????????????????The Orange County Register 29 2001 Tuesday SECTION: DOMESTIC NEWS KR-ACC-NO: ?K7500 LENGTH: 825 words HEADLINE: California's power crisis generating lots of heat BYLINE: By John Howard BODY: ??SACRAMENTO Calif. _ Detectives would seem to be tripping over each other to discover who did what to whom and why in California's energy crisis. ??While electricity may be scarce investigations are plentiful. A dozen major probes are afoot many overlap and more loom. The atmosphere is heated the rhetoric strong. State federal and local investigators along with court officers financial experts and special investigators are poring over thousands of pages of documents from government agencies and private companies. ??At the top of the swarming heap is the $10 million investigation mounted by the state Attorney General's Office to answer the core question: Did a handful of power sellers fix prices to bilk Californians of billions of dollars? ??But it's not just the government that is busy. The companies themselves _ which have categorically denied any wrongdoing _ are overwhelmed by the scrutiny. ??We are supplying reams and reams of documents. ... It is a distraction from our day-to-day work there's no question said Tom Williams of North Carolina-based Duke Energy which operates several power plants in California. It affects our employees and their families this barrage of innuendo. I don't know what more we can do. ??Accompanying the investigations are at least a half-dozen lawsuits against the companies by individuals. Like the probes the suits contend the companies improperly manipulated the market. Legislative leaders meanwhile have sued the federal government contending it has failed to protect consumers from price-gouging. ??This all permeates our business in so many ways said Gary Ackerman of the Western States Power Forum a group that represents power sellers and buyers in the West. It even affects my ability to talk to the newspapers because we're afraid statements may turn up later and be used as evidence. We're not sure what we're dealing with whether a suit or even a grand jury if the (attorney general) decides to take criminal action as he said he might. ??The state's top prosecutor said that indeed criminal charges are a possibility. ??There is an investigation under way that involves potential criminal conduct said Sandra Michioku a spokeswoman for Attorney General Bill Lockyer. It could be at least eight weeks before that probe is completed she said. ??Other investigating agencies include the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission the California Public Utilities Commission the city attorneys' offices in Long Beach Los Angeles and San Francisco California's grid manager the Independent System Operator the obscure Electricity Oversight Board which oversees the ISO and the state Senate and Assembly. ??The state has even considered asking two more federal agencies the Department of Energy and the Federal Trade Commission to get into the act. Some offices are conducting multiple investigations. In the case of at least two agencies the PUC and the Attorney General's Office the investigations are being at least partly coordinated. Some agencies are examining the same issues. The PUC the attorney general and ISO for example all are looking at whether power plants were shut down to drive up demand and prices. ??There is a lot of overlap and there probably are problems of coordination said Nettie Hoge of The Utility Reform Network of San Francisco a grass-roots watchdog group. ??With so many agencies trying to extract information Hoge said even those who have done no wrong are concerned about talking freely because of the greater likelihood that proprietary information will leak to competitors. ??Others feel the overlap is beneficial. ??When you're up against an industry as wealthy and powerful as the energy industry it's probably better to double-team them said Doug Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights. ??Hoge believes that if any investigation is going to produce results it will be Lockyer's because the governor has thrown all the resources that way. ??Investigators have requested mountains of paperwork. Transaction and maintenance documents market reports financial records even e-mails _ all have been sought. ??Martin Wilson a spokesman for Texas-based Reliant contends the intensity of the probes could have negative long-term effect on California's business climate. ??There is a climate of instability and uncertainty that makes companies rethink their decisions about investments (in California) he said. ??But for consumer groups the goal of all these investigations is straightforward. ??Certainly we're really hopeful that these investigations will lead to refunds for customers said TURN's Mindy Spatz. There is a widespread belief among people who follow these issues that widespread gaming and manipulation has occurred in the market. ??(c) 2001 The Orange County Register (Santa Ana Calif.). ??Visit the Register on the World Wide Web at http://www.ocregister.com/ JOURNAL-CODE: OC LOAD-DATE: May 29 2001 of 98 DOCUMENTS ?????????????????Copyright 2001 The Chronicle Publishing Co. ?????????????????????????The San Francisco Chronicle ?????????????????????MAY 29 2001 TUESDAY FINAL EDITION SECTION: NEWS Pg.

Those that weren't blamed it all on that most familiar of modern scapegoats the computer. ???Computers must be kept cool -- in the 60s for big mainframes and a bit more for the smaller units most folks use though some can go into the 80s without hiccuping. So generally people who work alongside the computers get to keep cool by association although it's the computer that counts. ???The ISO headquarters located in an industrial park 20 miles east of Sacramento is a delightfully cool and comfortable place when the outside temperature soars into the 90s and 100s. ???The reception area the only room accessible to the outraged public is a fairly stiff 76 degrees -- only two degrees cooler than the 78 degrees recommended by President Bush and the federal energy crisis czars and czarinas. ???But take a step past the lobby security doors and the temperature plummets. In the main hallway the temperature is 73 degrees. And in the control room where two dozen engineers and technicians sit at consoles and monitor the flow of California electricity on a giant diagram of state power lines so they can order blackouts for everyone else -- the temperature is 69 degrees. ???NO SWEATING AT ISO ???Some managers do not take off their sports coats and jackets. ???We want these people to be comfortable explained Tony Capasso facilities manager for the ISO complex. We don't want these people sweating bullets in the middle of a crisis. ???Inside the state Capitol where legislators and the governor preach compliance with federal guidelines calling for 78-degree thermostats the temperature dips into the high 60s. The coolest spots are the press briefing room and the treasurer's old office. ???GOVERNOR'S OFFICE ???The governor's suite is in the mid-70s apparently because folks are often coming by with thermometers and it wouldn't do not to set an example. Press secretary Steve Maviglio said Governor Gray Davis is a practice-what-he-preaches kind of guy who keeps corridors dark shades drawn air conditioners idle. His personal secretary works in short sleeves with a cheap plastic fan humming nearby. ???It's so dark in the hall that we're always bumping into things said one aide. ???Even so the temperature in the governor's suite of offices is three degrees cooler than the 78 degrees recommended by President Bush -- not the first time the two men have failed to agree. ???THE LEGISLATURE ???The Assembly chamber is 71 degrees while the Senate chamber -- with 40 fewer legislators spewing forth -- is 73 degrees. But the Senate chamber has a southern exposure one Capitol guide explained. ???Hot air from the people sitting inside has nothing to do with it he said. ???In San Francisco the temperature inside cavernous City Hall dips in spots to the mid-60s. College student Jasmine Westbrook who dropped by with her art class on a project to sketch the interior of the building was doing her sketching while wearing a windbreaker to keep warm. ???I want to stay comfortable she said. It think it's supposed to be hotter in here isn't it? ???The mayor's office at 73 degrees was eight degrees warmer than another office down the hall even without the mayor sitting in it. ???63 AT THE PUC ???At the headquarters of the state Public Utilities Commission which is supposed to be keeping an eye on the self-declared bankruptcy of the utility that mails out the bills the lobby temperature is 63 degrees. ???Chief engineer David Omosheyin eyeing The Chronicle's thermometer nervously insisted the 63-degree reading was caused by the lobby's proximity to the front door where the outside temperature at the moment was in the low 60s. He invited the thermometer to visit the upper floors where the temperature was 70. ???As for San Francisco's federal buildings: Bush would probably not frown. ???His orders appeared to be followed during The Chronicle's visits so much so that it was actually hotter inside than out. Though that wouldn't be hard considering it was in the low 60s outside. And the places measured happened to be courtrooms and tax offices where the body heat from anxiety alone could probably melt the paint some days. ???San Franciscans Omosheyin said are losing their perspective when it comes to things like electricity energy alerts and rolling blackouts. In his native country of Nigeria he said the electricity runs sporadically if at all. ???There the power can go off for a week he said. The world goes on. Here people take a lot of things for granted and electricity is one of them. ???As for the offices of the places that report on such matters they fared about the same. ???The Walnut Creek bureau of The Chronicle where the sun sizzles into the 90s with regularity in the summer is kept at 67 degrees because of all the computers.

Brad Sherman a Democrat from Thousand Oaks who met Air Force One on the tarmac at Los Angeles International Airport along with a group of high school students wasted no time button-holing the president for what appeared to be an animated conversation. ???I brought up . . . the idea that after his meeting with our governor I hoped he would be in favor of wholesale regulation (of energy prices) Sherman said later. He disagreed with me. ???Sherman -- who two weeks ago suggested that the headline to the president's national energy policy should be Bush to California: Drop Dead -- didn't seem optimistic yesterday about Bush's 48-hour visit to the state. I think that the president's policies show either a lack of understanding of what's really going on in California or a lack of concern he said. ???That vignette underscored some of the challenges facing Bush who arrived in California as protesters geared up and Democratic Gov. Gray Davis prepared to press him for federal action on the state's power troubles. ???Besides Sherman Bush was greeted by a crowd of cheering Republicans including Secretary of State Bill Jones and Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan the former a declared GOP candidate for governor in 2002 the latter a rumored one. ???But today Bush will sit down with the present governor who lately has been blistering in his criticism of the president. ???The last time I looked California was still part of the United States of America Davis told reporters this weekend. We have contributed disproportionately to the economic growth of this country. There's no reason why a president should not respond to a legitimate request from the chief executive of the largest state in the union. ???In his first visit to California since just before the election Bush plans to emphasize the energy crisis -- but will focus on it through the lens of his own energy plan. ???ENERGY SECRETARY ACTS ???Just hours before the president landed Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham ordered a speedup in planning to relieve a notoriously overloaded electricity transmission line in California. ???Abraham's holiday action was timed to provide a bit of positive news for Bush to announce in California. He ordered the Western Area Power Administration a 15-state marketing arm of the Energy Department to complete planning and seek outside financing to reduce the transmission bottleneck on California's Path 15 which connects the northern and southern parts of the state. ???This morning Bush will visit the Marine Corps base at Camp Pendleton near San Diego to underscore his conservation order for a 10 percent cut in energy usage in federal buildings and military facilities. ???In Los Angeles he will deliver a wide-ranging talk before the World Affairs Council and lead a discussion among business leaders about technological advances in energy conservation. ???Then he will head to Fresno and Sequoia National Park to press his initiative to improve national parks. Along the way protesters have vowed to provide a vocal commentary on Bush's energy and environmental policies. ???But the real drama of the trip will no doubt be the sit-down between Bush and Davis today. The governor pushed for a lengthy open meeting with Bush that would include testimony from officials and consumers affected by the energy crisis. Bush's camp announced Friday the meeting would be 20 to 30 minutes -- in private. ???Davis plans to outline steps the state has taken to alleviate the energy crisis and what it wants the federal government to do -- including implementing price caps on the wholesale cost of energy cost-based pricing and the possibility of ordering refunds. ???DAVIS THREATENING SUIT ???The governor has said he will consider suing the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission -- the agency charged with overseeing energy prices -- if it does not impose temporary price caps. ???And the state Legislature has already filed a suit saying the commission has failed to stop what it has determined are unjust and unreasonable prices. ???With California's energy woes worsening and a summer of rolling blackouts predicted the Bush-Davis session holds potentially deep political pitfalls for both leaders both of whom are suffering in state polls as a result of their handling of the energy crisis. ???Bush needs to demonstrate his concern for California a state that gave a 12-point margin of victory to Al Gore in the presidential election. ???But even as Bush adviser Karen Hughes told state reporters this week that the president had arrived to show he cares Vice President Dick Cheney again chastised state officials for delaying their response to the energy crisis because all of the action was potentially unpleasant. ???And Cheney signaled that the administration would resist long-term price caps saying We think that's a mistake. ???Such talk drew fire from Davis' senior political adviser Garry South who charged that Cheney's words demonstrated insensitivity to California's troubles and only underscored the perception of an all-oil all-the-time ticket. ???Davis whose campaign for re-election next year will depend on his handling of the crisis has stepped up his criticism of Bush and profit-hungry energy firms particularly those from Texas in recent weeks. ???And yesterday signaling no letup Davis' supporters made an unusual holiday conference call to again press his case for federal action. They argued that without immediate intervention from the Bush administration the economy of California -- and potentially the entire nation -- was at risk. ???'THIS ENORMOUS SHOCK' ???We have this enormous shock in prices that needs to be addressed and not ignored said Joseph Fichero head of Sabre Partners and a consultant to Davis. ???Alan Blinder a Princeton economist and former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve warned that energy woes in California alone would take almost a half a percent of the gross domestic product off of the national economy. ???Blinder and others argue that short-term relief -- for about 6 to 12 months -- is necessary while new power plants are being built. ???Most times and most places I agree price caps are not the long-run solution but they can be part of a short-term solution Blinder said. There really is a case for temporary price caps to shield consumers and the California and national economy from the full force of the energy shock. ???Limited new price caps approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on the sale of wholesale electricity begin today in California. But the temporary caps which go into effect when the electricity reserves dip below 7.5 percent have been lambasted by Davis as ineffective and inadequate. ???Political analysts say Bush's resistence on the issue could cost him in California -- and elsewhere. ???(California) is probably an area where he is criticized more than any other region in the country said Mark DiCamillo director of the statewide Field Poll.

Gray Davis will urge President Bush today to back a 2-year cap on electricity costs as the best way to keep his power-starved state -- and possibly the U.S. economy -- from sinking into recession. ???The Democratic governor and Republican president who have been sparring from afar over energy policy will meet here to discuss their differences. The White House has said repeatedly that it opposes price caps as a way to deal with energy shortages in California. ??In an interview with USA TODAY Davis said a limit on wholesale electricity costs is needed while the state attempts to build 15 new power plants. He said that would still allow a 30% profit margin. ??While the president didn't create this problem he is uniquely situated to solve it Davis said. I'll make clear that he has an opportunity to relieve the pain and give California the breathing space to put more plants online. ???Bush making his first visit to California as president unveiled a long-term energy policy this month that calls for increased production and to a lesser extent conservation. The president will promote conservation steps being taken by the federal government during a visit today to the Marine Corps base at Camp Pendleton. ??The president believes that imposing price caps will only make the problem worse White House spokesman Dan Bartlett said. ??Davis whose popularity has plummeted as Californians cope with blackouts to offset electricity shortages said his state's problems could hurt all Americans if they are not dealt with quickly. I'm asking for some form of relief that reduces the outrageous prices we're currently bearing he said. Without that relief lots of people will lose their businesses and California could well be dragged into a recession. Since we're about one-eighth of the national economy that doesn't bode well for America. ???The California Public Utilities Commission has announced rate increases of up to 50% for businesses and 37% for homes. ??Bush has sidestepped California after losing the state by 12 percentage points to Democrat Al Gore last year in the presidential election. But with Democrats targeting several GOP House members in next year's elections Republicans must go on the offensive or risk losing control of the closely divided House of Representatives. ??Davis a possible presidential candidate in 2004 said he wants to avoid rancor with Bush: I'm saying 'Look we got into this in a bipartisan way. We should get out of it in a bipartisan way.'

Gray Davis (D) on Tuesday. Bush's aides said he will pledge to cooperate with California but will stick to his position that no action by the federal government can prevent the rolling blackouts expected this summer. ???Abraham ordered the Western Area Power Administration a 15-state marketing arm of his department to complete planning and seek outside financing for an increase in transmission capacity that he said would be a big step in the right direction and a big step forward for Californians. ???California's electricity problems developed over a period of years and cannot be solved overnight Abraham said in a news release.

Today's action is designed to reduce the bottleneck on California's Path 15 which connects the northern and southern parts of the state. ???Davis who is seeking reelection next year has seen his poll ratings plummet as electricity prices soared utilities hit dire financial straits and homes and businesses were surprised with blackouts. ???Bush has taken several steps to try to encourage additional power generation in the state but has maintained since before he took office that California's problems were created here -- through a troubled effort at electricity deregulation and public opposition to construction of additional power plants -- and would have to be solved here. ???Davis plans to use the meeting to lobby Bush once again to endorse a cap by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on the wholesale price of electricity. Again and again the administration has said it will not take that step. ???This administration does not and will not support energy price controls Bush told a business audience in March. Price controls do not increase supply and they do not encourage conservation. Price controls contributed to the gas lines of the 1970s. And the United States will not repeat the mistake again. ???Davis energy advisers told reporters on a conference call today that without the cap California energy costs could be $ 50 billion higher this year than two years ago.

A03 LENGTH: 1936 words HEADLINE: It's Still Dawn for Solar Power in L.A. Despite City Subsidies Homeowners Hesitate to Install Expensive Alternative Energy Source BYLINE: William Booth Washington Post Staff Writer DATELINE: LOS ANGELES BODY: ???One year ago this city announced its intent to become the Solar Capital of the World with 100000 roofs covered with solar electric panels by the end of the decade an audacious goal to transform the homes of this smoggy but sunny metropolis into miniature power plants. ???To fulfill what is perhaps the nation's most ambitious solar campaign the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power began offering substantial buy down subsidies that would reimburse rate payers for half the price of each new solar energy system. For the average home a photovoltaic package costs between $ 10000 and $ 20000 parts and labor included before the rebate. ???How many have been installed? ???At last count about 40. ???That leaves only 99960 rooftops to go. ???The Bush administration and especially Vice President Cheney architect of its energy plan have been criticized for skepticism regarding alternative energy sources. But a close examination of the Los Angeles solar experiment and a review of similar programs suggest the former oilmen in the White House have a point: Solar at least has not proven ready for prime time. ???For all of Los Angeles's good intentions and for all of solar's many positive attributes the problems of harnessing its power remain. Some of those challenges are economic and some technological others are more mundane but often ignored such as finding a qualified contractor a homeowner can trust to drill dozens of holes in the roofs to mount the things. ???In a reprise of the 1980s solar again is hot. The price of photovoltaics is dropping and interest is growing. Other states such as New York Arizona Florida and Washington are moving to join California in major efforts to wire homes to draw power from the sun. ???But as many Americans are beginning to understand the delivery of energy is like a complex interconnected assembly line and the devil lurks in the details. ???The Los Angeles experiment tells the story shared by other locales. In L.A. for example the city's lone solar panel manufacturer has not been able to supply enough systems to meet demand. ???The systems too are often oversold by solar proponents. In the real world most do not pay for themselves in a few years as some advocates claim but take 20 years or more to return their initial cost in the form of reduced utility bills. ???Nor are the systems maintenance-free: At a minimum the rooftop panels must be routinely cleaned of pollution dust and leaves. ???They cannot be installed efficiently on homes without shade-free south-facing roofs the shadow from a neighbor's palm tree can frustrate the system's photovoltaic cells. ???Nor will the most common systems allow buyers to live off the grid unless they want to purchase a large bank of batteries. Even with the batteries homeowners probably would not be able to run their washing machines and air conditioners at the same time. ???It is not an economic proposition at this point conceded Terry Peterson a solar expert at Electric Power Research Institute in Palo Alto Calif. But one day Peterson predicts 100 years from now solar energy will provide a substantial percentage of the world's energy needs. In a decade or two the cost of solar will likely be competitive with other energy sources such as natural gas nuclear or coal. ???But now? It is still a luxury item. Like buying a swimming pool Peterson said. ???I really like the idea of running my house with solar power said Andrew Chin a potential customer in Los Angeles who has been researching a purchase. But they're still pretty expensive even with the rebates and so I gotta ask myself what am I doing this for his conscience or his wallet. I'm thinking I might wait until they work the kinks out. ???The most knowledgeable and experienced solar contractor in Los Angeles is probably Graham Owen the founder owner and single full-time employee of Go Solar Co. ???His installation of a one-kilowatt solar electric system on a home in the San Fernando Valley was the first to be awarded a rebate by the Los Angeles power department in March. ???How many systems has he installed as part of the rebate program? Three. ???But Owen is a true believer and over the next year he plans to cover hundreds of roofs with solar panels. On his shelf Owen still has an unreturned library book The Coming Age of Solar Energy published in 1963 and checked out from his high school in Lennox Hills Ill. in 1979. I guess we're still stuck in the coming age of solar energy he said smiling. He recalled that the buzz about solar water heaters in the 1980s led to disappointment with shoddy workmanship and less than spectacular energy savings. ???Until recently there has been little widespread interest in solar electric power. Since 1998 the California Energy Commission has been pushing its own program to encourage homeowners to erect photovoltaic panels on their roofs offering to subsidize about one-third of the cost. ???Across a state with a population of about 35 million only 450 solar energy systems have been installed on homes. ???Then the California energy crisis struck with its power interruptions and steep rate increases and the phone calls began to overwhelm Owen's voice mail. ???On days with rolling blackouts? I get a hundred calls maybe more Owen says. His Web site www.solarexpert.com is now receiving 3000 hits a day. Customers are begging him to do jobs. ???The Los Angeles power department reports a similar surge in interest since the energy crisis began six months ago. Customer demand has shot through the roof says Angelina Galiteva executive director for strategic planning at the Department of Water and Power. She estimates that her department receives 1000 calls on some days about its solar subsidy program. ???Yet while the reliability and cost of solar electric technologies continue to improve solar power today accounts for only a sliver of the national pie chart of energy production -- less than 1 percent. The country produces about 300 megawatts of electricity with solar -- about the same amount produced by a single mid-sized traditional power plant. ???The current trend for photovoltaics is not to erect large centralized solar farms in the desert an experiment that withered in the 1980s but to pursue distributed generation or individual units on scattered rooftops. ???The problem has consistently been the cost of the solar panels which has been too steep to justify them except for customers who are committed environmentalists or techies who like the elegance of the systems. ???Los Angeles began its solar experiment after Sacramento legislators mandated that utilities spend about 3 percent of their revenue on efficiency conservation and renewable energy. For solar the power department committed $ 75 million over the next five years -- enough to subsidize panels on 7500 homes. ???The power department will pay $ 5 for each watt of solar installed on a residence or business. Homeowners typically purchase a one-kilowatt or two- kilowatt (1000 or 2000 watts respectively) solar electric system meaning that the municipal utility would pay between $ 5000 and $ 10000 of the cost up front -- an enticing tax-free offer. ???For many years I wanted to do solar but it was so expensive said LaWanda Geary in the San Fernando Valley who in April had Owen install 32 panels for a two-kilowatt system on her sunny roof. The rebate really got me going. I don't know many times when the government offers to pay half of anything. ???The systems that are eligible for rebates must be tied into a utility's electric power grid meaning that during the day when the sun is shining the panels are adding a stream of electrons used by the home to run its lights and appliances. ???If there is a surplus of solar power that electricity goes back into the power lines and is passed along to a neighbor and the electric meter at the house actually runs backward. Homeowners however are not selling their excess electricity -- they're giving it away to the utility company. ???On cloudy days and at night the home is not being powered by solar energy but getting its electricity the traditional way from the power lines. ???Calculations on savings vary. A two-kilowatt solar system can supply an average-sized home with 20 to 80 percent of its electrical needs depending on how many lights appliances and air conditioners are running and how efficient they are. ???After the subsidy and depending on how the system is paid for (in cash or with borrowed funds) a solar system can pay for itself in as little as six years and as much as 36 years. Owen assumes about 20 years. ???Potential solar clients moreover often mistakenly assume that going with the sun will take them off the grid which is not possible without a large bank of batteries that costs several thousand dollars more. Because the solar panels are still wired to the power grid if there is a blackout the power in a solar house goes off just like everyone else's. If uninterrupted power is needed Owen suggests a diesel generator. ???Galiteva does cite one real advantage of solar: It reduces the electricity that must be purchased from power companies and protects to some degree a solar home from the full brunt of upwardly spiraling rate increases. Unfortunately for solar enthusiasts the L.A. Department of Water and Power which was not deregulated along with the three other major utilities in California has perhaps the cheapest and most stable supply of electricity in the state making the economic argument harder to make. ???To receive the full $ 5 per watt subsidy the L.A. Department of Water and Power requires a homeowner to purchase solar panels from a manufacturer based in the city. The idea is not only to become the solar capital of the world but also to encourage local growth of an emerging industry and create jobs. ???One hitch is that no solar panel makers were located in Los Angeles. ???After lengthy negotiations Siemens Solar Industries based in Camarillo Calif. an hour's drive to the north announced in February that it would open a solar panel manufacturing plant in Los Angeles. But it is not a complete facility: The L.A. plant does only some final assembly and then the units must be returned to Camarillo for final testing and shipping. ???Tina Nickerson a spokeswoman for Siemens Solar estimates her company has sold a couple dozen to L.A. homeowners for the rebate program. But she too reports that the interest from consumers is sometimes overwhelming and that supply has been a problem. Most U.S.-manufactured units are shipped overseas to places such as Germany Japan and Scandinavia which have had generous subsidies in place for years. ???LaWanda Geary had to call Siemens herself to push them to deliver panels for her house -- and she was eligible for the rebate because of a stopgap compromise that allows to Siemens to ship solar panels from Camarillo until its L.A. plant is fully operational. ???Everyone involved concedes there have been bottlenecks. Siemens now says it has enough panels to begin to meet demand and Owen and the city are hoping things will sort themselves out especially if more solar manufacturers are drawn to Los Angeles. But proponents worry about what will happen when the subsidies run out. ???Selling solar is now the easy part Owen says. I could sell a hundred a week. It's getting them up on the roof that's the hard part. LOAD-DATE: May 29 2001 of 98 DOCUMENTS ????????????????Copyright 2001 News World Communications Inc.

A6 LENGTH: 1264 words BYLINE: Greg Pierce THE WASHINGTON TIMES BODY: ??TAKING YOUR MEDICINE ??Oakland Mayor Jerry Brown who was once governor of California likens current Gov. ?Gray Davis' handling of the electricity crisis to his own bungling of the medfly crisis. ??Here's an analogy to the medfly crisis Mr. ?Brown said in an interview with the Los Angeles Times' Douglas Foster. ?When I first heard about the medfly I said 'Well it's just a few flies maybe they'll go away. ?Maybe they won't keep reproducing.' And the winter came and they stopped reproducing. ?And then somewhere around February or March I learned about something called 'spring emergence.' As the ground got warmer the larvae turned into flies and more medflies started appearing. It got out of hand and ultimately I had to order malathion spraying. ?It would have been better had I taken forceful action at the first notice of the medfly. ??Mr. ?Foster asked: Are you saying that the governor missed opportunities to act early in the same way? ??Mr. ?Brown replied: There's an analogy there. ?I didn't want to spray because I knew the people in Santa Clara County didn't want to have helicopters spraying malathion over their homes. ?It didn't sound good. ?As governor I wouldn't have wanted to see rate increases either. ?But sometimes you have to take your medicine early. ?It's less bitter than if you postpone it. ??Mr. ?Davis served as Mr. ?Brown's chief of staff when the latter Democrat was governor. ??ENERGETIC CRITICISM ??President Bush's energy plan already under fire from Democrats and environmentalists is dismissed by National Review the conservative magazine as so much political posturing. ??The hyperbolic attacks on the Bush plan by environmentalists (as an attempt to poison the air and kill the caribou) shouldn't trick conservatives into an exaggerated sense of its merit the magazine says in an editorial in its current issue dated June 11. ??The basic thrust of the administration's thinking on energy is sound: a growing economy requires more energy which in turn entails more production. But the Bush plan itself is a political document meant to placate corporate interests environmentalists and everyone in between and so is festooned with an embarrassment of subsidies and incentives that will at best prove an irrelevance. ??As Jerry Taylor of the Cato Institute writes in this issue the phantom energy crisis is already healing itself. ?Power plants are being built at a rate that outpaces Dick Cheney's benchmark of one plant a week. Altogether almost 100000 new daily megawatts of electrcity capacity are scheduled to be available nationwide by next year. ?This is twice the amount of electricity that California now uses on an average day. ?While Cheney has been sitting with his advisers around a White House conference table investors and entrepreneurs have been digging building and refining his energy problem into oblivion. ?By the time all the Bush plan's tax credits have kicked in there may well be an energy glut. ?All of this is thanks to the most efficient energy plan known to man: market pricing. ??WRONG ON BOTH COUNTS ??The buzz in the media after Sen. ?James Jeffords' switch put Democrats in control of the Senate was that President Bush must change his ways. ?He has to become more moderate. ?Why? ?Because only that will prevent more Republican defections and it's the president's one hope for getting his agenda through Congress. ?This is wrong on both counts Fred Barnes writes in the Weekly Standard. ??Bush and GOP congressional leaders bent over backwards to accommodate Jeffords and liberal Democrats on education the senator's top priority. Jeffords bolted anyway. ?On taxes Bush stuck with his conservative tax cut until nearly the end when he compromised just enough to assure passage. Jeffords voted with him Mr. ?Barnes said. ??The truth about the impact of Jeffords' move is that no political earthquake has occurred. ?The Senate is ideologically unchanged. ?The swing votes in the Senate including John McCain are important but they already were. ?There's no clear path to victory for the Bush agenda after taxes and education but that was always true. ?To pass a patients' bill of rights a prescription-drug benefit or missile defense a bipartisan coalition of some sort will be essential. ??Yes there's one big change with Democrats taking over: judges. ?Bush will have a harder time getting conservative nominees through a Senate Judiciary Committee run by Patrick Leahy perhaps the most partisan Democrat on Capitol Hill. ?One more downbeat side effect: Jeffords' announcement overshadowed Bush's tax-cut victory denying him any political momentum he might have gotten from it. ??INCOHERENT REBEL ??Before liberals put James Jeffords on Mount Rushmore can we please stop and note how he's already betrayed Democrats and his own avowed principles by deciding that his defection won't take effect until after President Bush's wrongheaded tax cut has been signed into law? syndicated columnist Matthew Miller writes. ??Any traitor (I mean 'man of conscience') worth his salt shoves the knife in to the hilt - otherwise what's the point? ?Machiavellis throughout history have wisely advised that when you move against the king you'd better finish him off Mr. ?Miller said. ??Yet Jeffords took pains to make sure his switch wouldn't derail the centerpiece of Bush's agenda the very agenda that inspired Jeffords' move and which Jeffords had the power to stop via his action. ??We are dealing in other words with a deeply incoherent rebel. ?This would be a private matter for Jeffords to sort out with his therapist were not his cowardice in this moment of 'courage' so consequential for the country. ??THE LONELY VERMONTER ??In the final analysis Vermont Sen. ?James M. ?Jeffords was out of step with his party making his departure appropriate if politically inconvenient. ?Those who argue that it was the party out of step with Jeffords some political analysts are saying are those who wish the Republicans no good. UPI political analyst Peter Roff writes. ??The conservative low-tax minimal-government Republican Party enjoys national parity with the Democrats something the Northeastern liberal GOP could not achieve. ?Jeffords is in that regard these observers say out of step with victory. ?One GOP consultant went so far as to say 'If the Republicans were doing better in New England Jeffords would not have been so lonely. ?Why is it that the people from states where the GOP usually doesn't win think they can tell the rest of us how to run the party and what we all should believe? ?It doesn't make sense.' (spade) ??There are those in the GOP who regret the loss of the majority that Jeffords' defection brings but very few if any are mourning the loss of the lonely Vermonter Mr. ?Roff said. ??LAST WORDS ??Brill's Content asked PR pros how they would handle Vice President Richard B. Cheney's heart problems. ??It's inconceivable that Mr. ?Cheney can put in the kind of time we're led to believe he is without putting himself at risk one public relations man John Scanlon told the magazine. ?My recipe for controlling the situation would be photo-ops access to his schedule and a couple of exclusive articles. ?He's got to convince people he's fit for the job. ??Unfortunately Mr. ?Scanlon did not live to see his quote in the magazine's June issue the New York Post reports. ?He died of a heart attack. ??* Greg Pierce can be reached at 202/636-3285 or by e-mail at gpierce@washingtontimes.com.

Both Mr. Bush and Vice President Richard B. ?Cheney who on Friday again blamed the state government of California for the energy crunch oppose cap measures. ??In his first visit to California since the presidential election where he lost the state to former Vice President Al Gore by 54 percent to 41 percent Mr. Bush hopes to sell his national energy policy to a vocal group of opponents. But the hue and cry has been muted of late since residents have battled rolling blackouts and sky-high gasoline prices. ??A new poll released Friday shows 59 percent of Californians many of whom have been longtime foes of nuclear energy now believe the non-polluting energy source may be the way to solve the state's problems. ??Mr. ?Davis' popularity has plummeted. ?The Democrat facing re-election next year and often mentioned as a presidential candidate is viewed as having poor job performance by 60 percent of Californians according to a survey by the Public Policy Institute of California. ??In a small gesture to California Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham yesterday announced plans to increase transmission capacity in California which he said would be a big step in easing rolling power blackouts. ??Abraham ordered the Western Area Power Administration - an Energy Department arm responsible for marketing electricity from federal water projects in 15 Western states - to wrap up planning for building extra transmission capacity. ??The governor has repeatedly blamed Mr. ?Bush who took office four months ago for the energy crunch in California. ?He points the finger of blame far outside the state's boundaries primarily at Washington and Mr. Bush's home state. ??The people that have dropped the ball are the federal government Mr. Davis said last week. ?They need to reimpose a price cap because we're being obscenely gouged by price gougers out of Texas and the Southwest. ?. . . There's a massive transfer of wealth going on from ordinary citizens in California to Texas. ??Mr. ?Davis has also charged that utility companies are withholding power in order to drive up prices a claim the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has investigated and dismissed. ??Mr. ?Bush and Mr. ?Cheney have often pointed out that California is second only to Rhode Island in conservation efforts but the state is on the brink of an energy supply collapse. ??Still despite the state's failure to build new power plants Mr. Davis says California is entitled to a federal bailout approved by Mr. Bush. ??I'm going to keep asking him to do it because we're part of America. The state the last three years has led American economic growth. ?. . . We're doing everything we can out here he said. ??In the Democratic response to the president's weekly radio address Mr. Davis accused the president a former oil man of being concerned only with the petroleum magnates. ??With all due respect I urge you to stand up to your friends in the energy business and exercise the federal government's exclusive responsibility to ensure that energy prices are reasonable he said. ??Many analysts however blame the state's deregulation scheme and failure to construct adequate electrical generating capacity. ?The price wholesale power providers can charge utilities is not capped but the fee those companies can charge users is capped - resulting in massive debt for providers. ??The state was slow to respond to increased demand the analysts say even though the state is building 10 new power plants four of which will come on line this summer. ??In his national energy policy Mr. ?Bush lays out 105 proposals that focus on increasing domestic supply improving the nation's ability to move energy between regions and increased conservation. ?But the policy is geared more toward long-term solutions - such as decreasing America's reliance on foreign oil - than short-term relief for Californians and motorists nationwide. ??Mr. ?Cheney who heads the president's energy task force and said Friday that California knew for more than a year about the impending energy shortage has promoted nuclear power as essential to America's energy needs. ?He said that at least some of the 65 power plants that need to be built annually to meet future electricity demand ought to be nuclear. ??A poll by the Field Institute last week found many Californians now agree. Although nuclear energy produces 20 percent of the nation's energy California has just two nuclear plants.

We live it every day in the comforts of peace and the gifts of freedom. ??Bush also laid a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknowns. ??Later he traveled to Mesa Ariz. to pay tribute to veterans at the Champlin Fighter Aircraft Museum. He asked the crowd to observe a nationwide moment of silence at 3 p.m. Arizona time. ??Any foe who might challenge our national resolve will be repeating the grave error of defeated adversaries the president said. ??Bush opened the day at the White House where he signed legislation to construct a World War II monument on the National Mall a setting criticized by some. Bush said the monument between the Washington Monument and Lincoln Memorial will stand for the ages. ??I will make sure the monument gets built the president told an audience of veterans in the yellow-curtained East Room among them former Sen. Bob Dole (R-Kan.) who has supported the memorial. ??. GRAPHIC: PHOTOPHOTO (color): President Bush and Maj. Gen. James T.

Gray Davis doesn't want to hear: He won't force down soaring electricity prices that have cost California nearly $8 billion since January. ??The Republican president and the embattled Democratic governor arranged a 20-meeting Tuesday to talk about California's energy crisis but there was no indication they would break their stalemate. ??Bush opposes price limits on wholesale electricity that utilities buy arguing they do nothing to address supply-and-demand issues at the heart of the crisis. ??Davis contends federal energy regulators are ignoring their mandate to ensure just and fair electricity prices. ??With no sign of a break in the deadlock each side maneuvered for maximum advantage from Bush's first full day in California as president. ??Davis in an interview Tuesday on ABC's Good Morning America defended his record on licensing more power plants. ??We've licensed 15 plants. Ten are under construction four will be online this summer four next summer and by the end of 2003 we will have built our way out of this problem. But between now and then we are getting gouged unbelievably Davis said. ??The Bush administration timed positive energy announcements to coincide with the president's visit. ??At the Marine Corps base at Camp Pendleton Bush was announcing the expansion of a program that provides federal money to help low-income residents pay for power. ??Bush was proposing $150 million in addition to $300 million already budgeted for a component of the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program to provide special help to cash-strapped residents of California and certain Midwest areas such as Chicago a senior administration aide said. ??Bush was also reminding state residents of his order that military facilities in the state cut peak-hour usage by 10 percent. ??To alleviate an electricity bottleneck on a crucial south-north transmission path the Department of Energy announced that the Western Area Power Authority will try to raise money from a variety of private and public entities to finance a crucial additional lines. ??The Bush administration is taking a leadership role in addressing a long-neglected problem in California's electricity transmission system said Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham. California's electricity problems developed over a period of years and cannot be solved overnight. However we can move now on actions that will help avert the same types of problems from recurring year after year. ??Davis had a letter for Bush from top economists who maintain price caps are justified and necessary. ??Aides to the governor expressed amazement that Bush would travel all the way to California with no major announcement in hand and predicted Davis would respond with polite rage. ??Mindful of the national stage he commanded Davis planned a news conference to air his grievances. And he convened a panel of families he said have been victimized by the energy crisis in the same hotel where Bush was staying. ??Davis wants Bush to pressure the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to impose stiff price caps. ??Tuesday limited caps ordered last month by FERC go into effect in California but only when electricity reserves fall below 7.5 percent in the state - a step Davis called inadequate. ??Protesters planned demonstrations in Los Angeles and at Camp Pendleton in San Diego County. ??Bush also arranged a speech on energy and trade to the Los Angeles World Affairs Council and planned to president over a closed-door energy round-table discussion.

Gray Davis was to meet President Bush to press for a federal cap on energy prices. ??But Davis wasn't expected to win any concessions during the 20-minute Tuesday meeting where he's expected to point to Texas energy makers. ??Davis has appeared on national news programs attacking Bush for opposing price controls on wholesale electricity and suggesting the president has ignored price-gouging by Texas-based electricity generators. ??The president did not create this problem but he is uniquely situated to solve it Davis said Monday. What I'm going to ask him to do with all respect is to enforce federal law. The money that leaves this state goes directly to energy companies in Texas and the Southwest. ??If Bush refuses to administer price controls as expected Davis can use that as ammunition in his sparring with the administration. ??Bush has blamed California officials for the state's power woes and said price controls won't solve shortages. Instead they said Bush plans to stress his efforts to conserve energy in federal buildings and will bring one or two new initiatives to the table. ??One of them commits the federal government to helping organize a consortium to build more power lines for the state. ??Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham directed the Western Area Power Administration a federal agency to take the first steps to clear the way for building more transmission capacity between southern and northern California. That would help relieve a transmission bottleneck in the central part of the state. ??While this will not help this summer Abraham said in a statement the line improvements when completed will help avert the same types of problems from recurring year after year. ??The stakes of the meeting are high for both politicians. ??Davis who has been mentioned as a Democratic challenger to Bush in 2004 wants federal help to solve an energy crunch that threatens rolling outages this summer and has cost state taxpayers nearly $8 million since January - the price of buying power for two cash-starved private utilities. And his plan to rescue one of those companies reportedly is faltering. ??Leaders of both the state Senate and Assembly oppose a $3 billion-plus plan to bail out Southern California Edison by buying its power lines the Los Angeles Times reported Monday. ??Bush meanwhile needs to mend fences in vote-heavy California. The Republican president lost badly here in November and polls show most Californians dislike his handling of their energy crisis. ??Bush's Tuesday agenda was heavy on energy issues. At the Marine Corps base at Camp Pendleton near San Diego Bush was to highlight his order that federal agencies and installations cut back energy use. Then it was on to Los Angeles to discuss his energy plan in a speech to the Los Angeles World Affairs Council. ??Bush was confronted by the issue virtually as he stepped off the plane Monday in Los Angeles. Rep. Brad Sherman D-Los Angeles escorted the Academic Decathlon national championship team from El Camino Real High School in Woodland Hills to meet Bush. He told the president California needs regulation of electric generators. ??The president seems to believe just by instinct that rate regulation reduces supply and also by instinct that all those in the energy industry are fair people who are not trying to game the system Sherman said. Anyone who studies the facts in California knows that power is being withheld in order to drive up the price.

Now that fact has not been lost on Governor Gray Davis who has accused the president of ignoring his state's power crisis. ?As ABC's Josh Gerstein tells us Mr. Bush's visit could have major ramifications for his presidency and his party. ??JOSH GERSTEIN reporting: ??(VO) Since taking office President Bush has visited 28 states but until this week he had not found time on his schedule to visit the nation's most populous state California. ??Mr. DAN SCHNUR (GOP Political Consultant): Because the state is going through such extraordinary times right now because of the energy crisis his absence has been much more noticeable and the discussion about it's been much more heightened. ??GERSTEIN: (VO) Democrats have begun an aggressive effort to paint the president and other Republicans as obstacles to resolving the energy crisis. ??Offscreen Voice: (From TV Commercial) President Bush has offered no relief to hard-pressed rate payers. ??Text: ??The President...believe(s) that the issue is mostly a California matter... ??GERSTEIN: (VO) On Tuesday Mr. Bush meets with California Governor Gray Davis. ?He and other Democrats want the federal government to impose caps on wholesale prices for electricity. ??Representative ANNA ESHOO (Democrat California): Our people are hurting. We're bleeding in the sand. ?We need a tourniquet and the president is the one that can do this. ??GERSTEIN: (VO) During his trip President Bush plans to highlight the federal government's conservation efforts but aides say he will not endorse price caps. ??Mr. TUCKER ESKEW (Director White House Media Affairs): The president believes that capping wholesale prices would do nothing to lower demand or increase supply the two fundamental solutions to any energy problem such as this. ??GERSTEIN: Holding the line against price caps may have political costs. Most analysts give Mr. Bush little chance of winning California in 2004 but Republican congressmen there face re-election next year. ?So far five of them have endorsed some kind of limit on electricity pricing. ??Representative RANDY CUNNINGHAM (Republican California): We're in an extreme emergency right now. ?It takes extreme measures. ??Unidentified Woman: We are in rolling blackouts. ??GERSTEIN: (VO) While electricity may be in very short supply in California this summer the president and politicians of all stripes are likely to find there's more than enough voter anger to go around. ?Josh Gerstein ABC News the White House.

1000,Update Day 1 Second Session FERC CA Settlement,In the Room Conference attended by all in-state generators a few munies the IOUs and a few others. One attorney from CPUC but on phone. Barbara Barkovich attended for CA Large Consumers. Nader sent someone. No other consumers. One other ESP -- Strategic Energy (only operates in San Diego). Judge reports that only 6 offers have been submitted to FERC for sales to the IOUs (note Enron submitted one of the offers). The offers total 2000 MW. The prices are quite divergent. He expresses concern at the little offered. Generators suggest that more could be offered if FERC could be more flexible on terms (FERC required 24/7 offers). IOUs and others press judge to seek offers from others not present (e.g. BPA other marketers SW utilities) but judge does not offer to do so. Barkovich says can't throw large customers into non-core market now. Everyone agrees that we are all looking for a blended wholesale rate (part existing gen part OFs part forward contract and part spot) that meshes with the IOUs' ability to recover the costs in rates -- so tied to CPUC rate increase. Discussion of CPUC PD -- not enough Enron able to take low profile. SDG&E suggested terminating the settlement talks at FERC saying nothing could be achieved. Not much happens until 4:30 pm when judge blows up -- judge directed epithets at SDG&E and SCE. SCE had refused to cooperate from the beginning. Out of the Room Separate talks between PG&E and SDG&E and some of the generators. Late in the day Judge meets with IOUs. Parties agree informally that forum does not work well given lack of CPUC involvement but some believe that FERC is only hope for a workable resolution. Next Steps -- The Judge Speaks Judge asked everyone to consider how to Share the Pain for Thursday's meeting and said not to expect any win:win scenario. His view is that FERC is better than the CA legislature or bankruptcy court. His focus will be on Wolak proposal to share the pain as submitted in 12/1/00 comments to FERC -- forces all sellers to CA to sell most of its supply (either generation or marketer offers) as cost-based rates in forward contracts or lose ability to sell at market-based rates. Generators oppose this I believe. Enron planning to continue low profile but to discuss options with ENA.,"Email; Enron; Release Draft

1015,Barton Subcommittee Approves California Bill; Price Caps Defeated,The Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee meet for almost six hours today and approved an amended version of H.R. 1647 Chairman Barton's emergency legislation to aid California by a 17-13 party line vote. The full Energy and Commerce Committee may take it up as early as next week (probably Thursday May 17th). The Subcommittee DEFEATED an amendment by Rep. Waxman (D-CA) to impose wholesale price caps for 18 months. The amendment was defeated 12-20 with all Republicans voting against including the three from California and Rep. Greg Walden (R-OR) who while seen as the last to decide to oppose the price cap amendment was the most forceful and articulate in opposition to the amendment. Also voting NO were Democratic Reps. Ralph Hall (D-TX) and Chris John (D-TX) with which we had met in recent days. The final vote tracked our whip count going into the meeting. Rep. Albert Wynn (D-MD) offered and withdrew an amendment to delete the negawatts provision. There was bipartisan criticism that while the concept made sense there were potential problems in terms of possible games playing including end users being able to sell power while not actualy reducing their normal power levels. Another member said that electric coops that are required to sell at cost could have customers then go out and resell that power and make a lot of money. Several Members said businesses could shut down put workers out of work and become energy marketers and make more money. Chairman Barton made a forceful defense of negawatts. While the amendment to strike was deleted we will need to respond to these criticisms and shore this up before full committee next week. There will be another attempt to delete at full committee unless these concerns are addressed in an amended version. Ranking Democrat Rick Boucher (D-VA) offered and withdrew an amendment to reinstate FERC maximum prices for the secondary transmission market thus reversing the Feb. 2000 FERC order. This woudl last for 18 months. Chairman Barton said he agreed with Boucher that there is a problem with what appear to be high gas transmission rates to California but he disagrees with the proposed remedy. He pledged to work with Boucher before Full Committee mark-up. We are obtaining a copy of this amendment and should analyze it ASAP for its potential impact on Enron operations. Rep. Ed Markey (D-MA) offered and withdrew an amendment to impose a series of new tests to be administered by FERC all with the goal of discouraging spot market transactions or at least what he would define as excessive use of the spot market and at the same time encourage deep bilateral mechanisms. The mechanisms included a market balance test that would say only sellers with a commitment to the long term market could sell in the spot market at unregulated rates and spot market circuit breakers that would be triggered when reserves are low in a given market. Chairman Barton said he likes the concept of a spot market circuit breaker but felt that the amendment was too complicated to be evaluated today. We will also pursue an analysis of this amendment since it will likely be offered again in some form. Mr. Markey also offered and withdrew a net metering proposal that would establish federal interconnection standards for individual consumers who would want to use fuel cells and other renewable technology to put power onto the system. It was interesting that those who opposed negawatts spoke favorably of net metering even though they are complementary. The subcommittee by voice vote adopted a Walden Amendment to strike the section of the bill that would have required an RTO if 10 of the western governors approved it. The debate was pro-RTO but the rationale for deleting the provision is that one is already being formed and Members from those states did not want to upset the work already under way. A series of other amendments on other matters were offered and withdrawn none of which relate to our activities.,"Energy Policy; Legislation; California; FERC; RTOs

1019,Re: Enron and the Energy Services Issue Before The WTO,I need you to run these items by Rick. I take full responsibility for approving the hiring of the Hills firm (and I look forward to meeting with you and Carla as we discussed) but remain hopeful we can use their services for something other than WTO. In the wake of Seattle and as I have come to understand better what the WTO can and cannot do for us on the energy services front I have come to the view that our talent and money would be better spent on other activities. My inclination is to do the bare minimum necessary to keep the machine going. If we have specifically committed to certain things then let's follow through. If there are things we can avoid let's avoid them. Specifically with respect to Fischer going to Geneva Why not have him available by phone at all hours to provide assistance and mage that known to USG instead of underwriting additional travel. With respect to the Hills firm can we use the retained time to help with the specific strategies we are now working out for the regions? These are the kinds of things we need to consider. Joe Hillings@ENRON 04/19/2000 04:13 AM To: Steven J Kean/HOU/EES@EES cc: Subject: Enron and the Energy Services Issue Before The WTO Steve: This is a brief extension of our conversation yesterday afternoon putting in print some of the upcoming dates and possible committments for your consideration and decision. We have no exit strategy at this time and in order to follow your general instructions to withdraw gradually (I'm not quite certain that is possible at this stage) you need to know the following. The April meeting at the WTO in Geneva (Committee on Specific Committments) spent considerable time discussing how energy services would be considered in the WTO GATS (General Agreement on Trade and Services) . The USTR raised the issue tabled the issue and guided the discussion. We did not send anyone to that session. As planned for several months we issued the Rachel Thompson study which is completing its basic distribution now. There has already been considerable interest in the study and I fully expect it to generate discussion in the days ahead. I have sent you the correspondence from the Japanese Ministry. Tonight I am hosting a small dinner for the top staff person for the leading Japanese business organization affiliated with the CSI organization. He raised the issue of Japan's industry feeling energy services was going too fast too soon when Ken addressed the WTO Ministerial Forum last December in Seattle. Now he has told Bob Vastine president of CSI that he was told later by his collegues that his statement was a misstatement. We'll hear more tonight. Later today the ESC Executive Committee is meeting with the DOE to discuss how they can support energy services for the USTR who has lacked technical advisers since Donna Bobbich and Russ Profozich left DOE earlier this year. DOE has appointed a group to help USTR and this is an orientation meeting held at their request. Next week I have scheduled the first ESC full meeting since January to update members (now 50 since Schlumberger joined on Friday) on developments which is essentially a report by USTR Carol Balassa who is the responsible official handling energy services. She has given a couple of us a debriefing on what happened at the WTO meeting and a request to prepare more detailed information for the May 10 meeting in Geneva where she tells us that energy services will be even more involved in the discussion. We should have Bob Fisher go to that meeting to be of assistance. This is a decision point for you. We have made some other committments which are also decision points although the Helsinki meeting on June 18th has been agreed upon based on my feelings that when I discussed it (the SCO/FSN Showcase Europe) in Houston with you and Rick you raised no objection which I took as agreeing that it should go forward. We have done this meeting annually where I have brought in someone from Enron companies to brief them and host them for dinner. These are the commercial people in the US embassies throughout Europe and the former Soviet Union. They are important points of contact for our commercial people. This year they want to have energy services in the WTO and as we would like them to exist in their territory. A few members of the ESC Executive Committee will do the former and Peter Styles the later. I have organized the dinner. Following that meeting is one that EC Trade staffer Uta Klinkers wants the ESC Executive Committee to put on in Brussels which is a joint meeting she is organizing with European energy industry representatives. This is a dialogue on energy services. The EU is an important player in the WTO and Uta who recently met with the ESC Executive Committee in Washington is quite supportive of liberalized energy services. At the EC she reports directly to Commissioner Pascal Lamy. Rick's memo this week suggested we have Peter Styles do this briefing. Peter is not an American and is not affiliated with the ESC. Therefore unless we participate Europe's energy industry is not talking with US industry. If this is what you want then I should tell Uta that we are unable to do the meeting. The last meeting is the presentation by Ken Lay at the OECD Forum 2000 on June 26 which I engineered with Doug Worth Secretary General of the BIAC (Business Industry Affairs Committee) to the OECD. This is a major world conference and Ken is addressing e-commerce and services. Doug an American and former head of the Washington IBM office wants to have Ken meet with OECD Commissioners in a smaller meeting to discuss trends for the future. I had planned to be there with Ken for the day day and a half he will be in Paris. I introduced our company to the OECD several years ago and it has become increasingly involved in issues of interest to us. Well these are the near-term items that require your fine hand if we are to proceed. A dramatic drop off at this time will have its effects and no one is likely to pick up our leadership. There is growing support for what has been accomplished and the USG plus others are now hooked on the energy services agenda. I cannot easily see an exit strategy that can do anything but cause criticism at this point. This is definately a longer term committment that I thought we had made when approval was given to hire the Hills firm. However if you want to exit other than pulling back from the Brussels meeting I think the other meetings are firm committements at this point. These are some thoughts for your consideration and decision. Joe,"Energy; WTO; Enron; Meetings

1031,Project California,I agree with Rick. I know Jose is tied up on current business but his input will be important. To date we have been relying on legal analysis of required approvals etc. That information is essential but it is as you know about 10% of the issue. The far more critical considerations are how is the government likely to react on a political level and what can we do about it.

1034,Re: HP -- confidential internal document,This is an excellent update. Thanks for putting this together. Dale/Patrick - lets regroup on how we want to move this onward. Seems like SJ's suggestion of our spending more time with Bill Dwyer is a good one. Thanks Matt Sarah-Joy Hunter@ENRON 12/12/00 02:42 PM To: Matt Harris/Enron Communications@Enron Communications cc: Patrick Tucker/Enron Communications@Enron Communications Peter Goebel/NA/Enron@Enron Dale Clark/Enron Communications@Enron Communications Jennifer Medcalf/NA/Enron@Enron Subject: HP -- confidential internal document Matt: As GSS Business Development transitions the HP relationship for broadband to your team there are several issues I wanted to clarify in terms of how the relationship has been developed and who the contacts have been to date. Additionally I outlined the discussion points/action items from this morning's meeting you held with Jennifer Medcalf and myself. Per your request the HP presentation complete with a listing of HP's business partners was e-mailed to you this morning. HP contacts to date: Bill Lovejoy Western Gulf Area Sales Manager Houston TX #(713)-439-5587 (Gerry Cashiola's boss) Gerry Cashiola sales representative Houston TX #(713)-439-5555 (To date HP person coordinating the relationship--seeking a short term play) Greg Pyle Solution Control Manager Southeast Region Austin TX (#(512)-257-5735 (Pyle has been playing the business developer role but continues to defer leadership of the process to Gerry Cashiola) Daniel Morgridge Manager of Internet - E-Services long term alliances Austin TX #(512)-257-5736 (Interested in E-services/wireless longer term alliances) Bill Dwyer Chief Architect e-Services Solutions Cupertino CA #(408)-447-5240 (To date clearly the most knowledgeable person on HP's business propositions strong technical financial background to craft value propositions. Gerry Cashiola and Greg Pyle deferred to his judgement in the 11/16th meeting) Matt On November 10th GSS Business Development took HP through a tour of Enron's trading floor the gas control center and the peaking power plant unit center on the trading floor. This tour was one meeting amongst several held in October and November to provide HP a full overview of Enron's products and services and introduce them to appropriate contacts at Enron (EBS GSS buy side -- Peter Goebel). On November 16th GSS Business Development Patrick Tucker and Dale Clark outlined 3 possible EBS/HP focus areas -- connectivity storage and wireless. Three EBS action items were defined in that meeting: 1) HP was to provide an HP contact on connectivity (to date Gerry Cashiola has stalled on providing this). Sarah-Joy will continue to pursue this information and get a sense from Gerry Cashiola of what he means by short term opportunity. What is HP's time horizon for short term? 2) EBS and GSS/BD was to facilitate a conference call on Storage with Ravi to explore size and potential scope of opportunity (completed 12/8) 3) GSS/BD was to facilitate a conference call with Peter Goebel GSS IT Sourcing Portfolio Leader (set for 12/14) In conversations with you Jennifer Medcalf and myself this morning several decisions on forward-looking strategy with HP/EBS were confirmed: Gerry Cashiola has been unable to take control of the process. More importantly despite numerous visits to Enron in which he has had overviews of Enron's products and services met with Peter Goebel and his team on the GSS buy side and participated in an Experience Enron tour Gerry has been unable to define an HP business proposition. The coordination between Cashiola (short term initiative) Morgridge (long term 12-24 months) has remained unorganized. These initiatives need to be developed separately. Clearly the conversations with HP need to be elevated to a more senior level so EBS can work with HP decision makers who can move the relationship forward at a strategic level. As the relationship is developed at this strategic level shorter term opportunities will crop up along the way. But Gerry's short term plans will not be the focus of the EBS/HP relationship rather a by-product. To facilitate this process of elevating the relationship Jennifer Medcalf and I are following up with Bill Lovejoy and Greg Pyle. Lovejoy's boss is Dan Sytsma VP of HP's America's Central Region. In the conference call Thursday 12/14 with Peter Goebel and HP regarding wireless initiatives Peter will support the GSS/BD push for the HP/EBS initiative by reiterating the following two points: a) Enron is already an HP customer the onus is on HP to move forward on the process of building a strategic relationship (IBM and Lexmark are only some of the HP competitors who could push them out of the running) b) HP's ability to bring the right people to the table will influence HP's business relationship process with Enron Patrick Tucker and Dale Clark could build their relationship with Bill Dwyer Chief Architect e-Services Solutions (met at the meeting 11/16) in the near term. Perhaps plan a visit to Cupertino California to see Dwyer in person. We look forward to continuing close collaboration with your team on this and other opportunities.

1036,Merger News Articles,A full list of news articles will be distributed on Monday but here is som= e of the initial coverage. Business/Financial Desk Section A Rival to Buy Enron Top Energy Trader After Financial Fall By ALEX BERENSON and ANDREW ROSS SORKIN 11/10/2001 The New York Times=20 Page 1 Column 2 c. 2001 New York Times Company=20 With its stock plunging and its finances in doubt the world's largest ener= gy trader the Enron Corporation agreed to be acquired yesterday by the ri= val Dynegy Inc. for about $9 billion in stock and the assumption of $13 bil= lion in debt.=20 The deal is an extraordinary turnabout for Enron a Houston-based company t= hat had been a driving force behind electricity deregulation nationwide. Its chairman Kenneth L. Lay a big contributor to the Republican Party pr= ovided political influence while its former chief executive Jeffrey K. Sk= illing helped create markets for the trading of electricity and natural ga= s. But last winter when California's effort to deregulate the electricity = market led to soaring power prices and rolling blackouts Enron was the sub= ject of much criticism and political anger.=20 Recent disclosures of discrepancies in Enron's financial statements and an = investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission caused the shares t= o plunge this week to their lowest level in a decade. As other companies be= came wary of doing business with it Enron -- also facing a potential cash = squeeze -- apparently had little choice but to find a buyer and a deal was= hastily cobbled together this week.=20 For critics who had complained about Enron's market power and its dominance=  the combination poses additional concerns. Dynegy's acquisition of Enron = will be reviewed by state and federal agencies led by the Justice Departme= nt and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Analysts said today that t= hey expected scrutiny of the combined companies' holdings in California wh= ere Dynegy owns power-generating plants and Enron accounts for much of the = trading of natural gas -- fuel for the state's electric power plants.=20 Buying Enron at a deep discount -- it has lost $60 billion in market value = this year -- could make Dynegy the dominant trader of electricity and natur= al gas. But the agreement carries big risks as well. Along with Enron's gas= pipelines and high-technology trading floor Dynegy will take on Enron's s= ubstantial debt and a web of complex transactions that Enron has spun over = the last decade.=20 In addition to the $13 billion in debt that Enron carries on its books it = has guaranteed at least $4 billion in off-balance sheet loans and the hidd= en debt could total as much as $10 billion said Carol Coale a stock analy= st with Prudential Securities.=20 Charles L. Watson Dynegy's chairman and chief executive said yesterday th= at Dynegy could sort through Enron's tangled finances. ''We know the compan= y well'' Mr. Watson said. ''It's not like we just started fresh. I'm confi= dent that it's as solid as we thought it was.''=20 The new company will combine Enron's 25000-mile natural gas pipeline syste= m with the large number of power plants that Dynegy owns worldwide as well= as Illinois Power a Dynegy subsidiary that serves 650000 customers in Il= linois. But its most important asset will be its trading desk. It will be t= he largest energy trader in the nation trading more than twice as much pow= er and natural gas as its closest competitors.=20 Mr. Watson said the company did not expect to sell significant properties a= nd that the deal should pass regulatory scrutiny. ''There's really not a lo= t of overlap in assets'' he said.=20 Mr. Watson and Steve Bergstrom Dynegy's president will hold those positio= ns in the new company which will be called Dynegy and remain in Houston. M= r. Lay who created Enron in the mid-1980's will not have any role in the = combined company's daily operations. He has been asked to join its board bu= t has not provided an answer. ''The last three weeks haven't been a lot of = fun'' he said.=20 In a statement announcing the agreement yesterday afternoon Mr. Watson sai= d he was confident that the merger would produce a strong new company. ''En= ron is the ideal strategic partner for Dynegy'' Mr. Watson said. ''We will= keep a strong balance sheet and straightforward financial structure as key= priorities.''=20 To shore up Enron's finances Dynegy will immediately put $1.5 billion into= Enron through ChevronTexaco the giant oil company which already owns 27 = percent of Dynegy. Another billion dollars will be injected once the deal i= s completed.=20 Investors appeared comfortable yesterday that Dynegy could make the deal wo= rk. After falling $3 to $33 on Wednesday when the companies first said t= hey were in discussions Dynegy rose $5.76 on Thursday and yesterday to clo= se the week at $38.76.=20 ''On paper it works'' Ms. Coale of Prudential said. ''The combined compan= y would be the leading trader the market leader in most of their businesse= s.'' Ms. Coale who has a sell rating on Enron and a buy rating on Dynegy = said she planned to keep her buy rating on Dynegy.=20 As it works to have the deal approved Dynegy will have to persuade Enron's= traders to stay with the combined company. The pain of the stock's 90 perc= ent plunge this year will not be equally shared. Some Enron employees have = held onto their shares and seen their retirement accounts eviscerated. Mean= while Mr. Lay Mr. Skilling and other former and current executives sold h= undreds of millions of dollars in Enron stock in 2000 and this year.=20 The companies also have very different corporate cultures. Dynegy emphasize= s teamwork while Enron is more competitive said Ehud Ronn director of th= e Center for Energy Finance Education and Research at the University of Tex= as. Even before the merger was announced Enron had lost some of its employ= ees to other energy trading companies Mr. Ronn said.=20 Some investors and analysts say that the problems with Enron's finances may= extend beyond the partnerships that have been the subject of Wall Street's= scrutiny the last month. James Chanos a short-seller who has been one of = Enron's most vocal critics said there was increasing evidence that Enron's= energy trading operations were not as profitable as the company had said. = ''There appears to be a culture at Enron of aggressively booking profits an= d deferring or obscuring losses'' Mr. Chanos said.=20 On Thursday Enron said in a filing with the S.E.C that it had overstated i= ts earnings by almost $600 million over the last five years. Mr. Chanos sai= d more restatements were possible noting that the filing disclosed partner= ships had been used to hedge almost $1 billion in losses in 2000 and this y= ear. So far the losses from those partnerships remain off Enron's financia= l statements Mr. Chanos said.=20 Enron's stock had been under pressure for most of this year as the company= ran up large losses with failed efforts to expand outside its core trading= operation. In August Mr. Skilling resigned as chief executive and Mr. La= y resumed control of daily operations.=20 Still the company appeared financially sound until last month when it dis= closed that its shareholders' equity a measure of the company's value dro= pped by $1.2 billion because of deals disclosed only hazily in its financia= l statements. The announcement unnerved investors who wondered whether Enr= on had found ways to inflate its profits and move debt off its balance shee= t and led the S.E.C. to begin an investigation.=20 Mr. Lay tried to reassure investors that Enron's finances were in order and= that its businesses remained strong. But the last three weeks have brought= a series of damaging revelations about partnerships that Enron formed with= some of its top executives including its former chief financial officer = Andrew S. Fastow.=20 With questions mounting the major credit-rating agencies began to downgrad= e Enron's debt putting additional pressure on the company. If Enron's debt= rating falls below investment grade it would be forced to repay $3.3 bill= ion in loans that it had guaranteed.=20 To strengthen its balance sheet and bolster its stock Enron turned to big = investors like Warren E. Buffett in search of billions of dollars of financ= ing. When the financing did not quickly appear its stock fell further.=20 By this week some major energy traders were refusing to extend credit to E= nron worrying that the company would be unable to make good on its contrac= ts. The Mirant Corporation an Atlanta-based power plant owner and electric= ity trader sharply curtailed its trading with Enron this week. ''We're tra= ding with them on a very limited basis'' said James Peters a Mirant spoke= sman. ''It's not business as usual.''=20 On Wednesday Enron's stock fell as low as $7 a share its lowest level in = more than a decade. That day news of the Enron and Dynegy talks leaked out= .=20 By late Wednesday the boards of the two companies had tentatively agreed t= o a deal. But Dynegy refused to go ahead until it learned whether Enron's c= redit rating would remain investment grade and was comfortable with the eff= ect of the deal on its own rating. The deal moved forward yesterday after D= ynegy was assured Enron's debt was not in danger of being lowered to junk s= tatus soon after the deal was announced according to company officials.=20 Dynegy and Enron had provided Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investors Servi= ce the main credit agencies with statements showing them what a combined = company might look like and asked the ratings agencies for an expedited rev= iew of the transaction Mr. Watson said.=20 Under the deal Enron shareholders will receive 0.2685 share of Dynegy stoc= k for each Enron share or $9.80 based on Dynegy's closing price on Thursda= y. Enron's stock gained 22 cents yesterday to $8.63.=20 ''I never thought our stock price would be at this level'' Mr. Lay said ye= sterday.=20 Enron's shareholders will own only 36 percent of the combined company and = Dynegy will name at least 11 members of the company's 14-member board.=20 If the deal falls apart Enron or Dynegy will have to pay a breakup fee of = $350 million.=20 To protect Dynegy's and ChevronTexaco's cash infusion the money will go to= an Enron unit that owns the Northern Natural Gas Pipeline. If the merger i= s not completed Dynegy will have the right to buy the unit.=20 An army of bankers and lawyers advised the companies. Lehman Brothers Inc. = acted as financial adviser and Baker Botts and Akin Gump Strauss Hauer &= Feld acted as counsel for Dynegy. J. P.

OPPEL Jr. 11/10/2001 The New York Times=20 Page 1 Column 2 c. 2001 New York Times Company=20 WASHINGTON Nov. 9 -- For years the Enron Corporation used its political m= uscle to build the markets in which it thrived pushing relentlessly on Cap= itol Hill and in bureaucratic backwaters to deregulate the nation's natural= gas and electricity businesses.=20 Its achievement as one Enron executive said today in creating a ''regulat= ory black hole'' fit nicely with what he called the company's ''core manage= ment philosophy which was to be the first mover into a market and to make = money in the initial chaos and lack of transparency.'' Now Wall Street's dissatisfaction with Enron's secretive ways has delivere= d the company into the arms of its much smaller Houston rival Dynegy Inc.= in a deal worth about $9 billion in stock and the assumption of $13 billio= n in debt. The combination of the two companies energy experts and lawmake= rs said today poses a novel set of challenges for regulators still struggl= ing to grasp the complexities of the marketplace that Enron invented.=20 ''We're in a supersonic-speed era of electronic trading with a horse-and-bu= ggy-era regulatory system to protect consumers'' said Representative Edwar= d J. Markey a Massachusetts Democrat who has devised legislation to close = the regulatory gap.=20 Dynegy's acquisition of Enron is expected to be reviewed by numerous state = and federal agencies led by the Justice Department the Federal Trade Comm= ission and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.=20 Analysts said today that sharp scrutiny would be given to the combined comp= anies' holdings in California where Dynegy owns generating plants and Enro= n controls a large part of the market for trading natural gas -- the fuel f= or a big share of the state's electric power plants.=20 ''Dynegy would now have a greater ability to take the dominant position in = gas and raise the price of electricity'' said Frank Wolak a professor of = economics at Stanford University.=20 Mr. Wolak a consultant to the Justice Department on a 1999 antitrust case = that led to limits on another merger of electricity and natural gas compani= es in Southern California said he was skeptical that regulators were up to= the task of reviewing today's deal.=20 The transaction ''is something the Department of Justice needs to look at = and they are going to have a hard time looking at'' Mr. Wolak said. ''And = it's beyond the ability of the F.E.R.C. to look at.''=20 Pat Wood -- named chairman of the federal energy commission earlier this ye= ar with the backing of Kenneth L. Lay the chairman of Enron -- acknowledge= d in an interview today that the agency had ''a long way to go'' in matchin= g the sophistication of the companies it regulates.=20 But he said that the commission had made great strides in grappling with th= e new risk management techniques pioneered by Enron Dynegy and other energ= y companies. It is hiring more experts he said adopting more restrictive = rules on how much ''market power'' one party can control and requiring more= disclosure of certain energy transactions.=20 In an interview this evening Charles L. Watson the chairman of Dynegy sa= id he did not believe that regulators reviewing the deal with Enron would r= equire the sale of any assets. ''We haven't really identified any pitfalls = that require any sort of asset divestiture'' he said. ''There's not really= any overlap.''=20 A senior executive at one of Enron's largest energy-trading rivals disagree= d. ''I don't think this deal gets through unscathed'' he said today. ''I'm= sure the Justice Department and the F.T.C. will look closely at the pretty= substantial concentration of market power these companies will have in the= energy-trading area.''=20 Enron is mainly a trader of natural gas and electricity -- indeed the bigg= est player in both those markets -- and it also owns a network of gas pipel= ines. Dynegy processes and sells natural gas and generates and sells electr= icity. Each company owns a local electric utility too: Dynegy owns Illinoi= s Power in Decatur Ill. while Enron owns Portland General Electric in Por= tland Ore. but last month announced plans to sell it to another Oregon ut= ility.=20 For a decade as it transformed itself from a gas pipeline operator into th= e nation's biggest energy trader Enron enjoyed unalloyed lobbying success = in Washington and the enthusiastic backing of Wall Street.=20 In the early months of the Bush administration Mr. Lay -- whose company wa= s one of the biggest financial backers of George W. Bush's presidential cam= paign -- played a prominent and some said unusual role in helping the Whi= te House pick nominees to the federal energy commission. Enron executives m= et with Vice President Dick Cheney whose energy task force backed many of = the deregulatory initiatives pushed by Mr. Lay.=20 Now ''the company has become a pariah'' an Enron executive said today. ''= The Bush administration doesn't want to have anything to do with us.''=20 The problems began with the energy crisis in California where Enron's outs= poken defense of deregulation even more than its electricity trading activ= ities made the company a favorite whipping boy of politicians and consumer= advocates. In the financial markets meanwhile Enron's confusing disclosu= res tolerated when its stock was soaring drew disdain as the calming of t= he energy storms in California and other parts of the country beat the shar= es down starting last spring.=20 ''Enron fell victim to their own inconsistencies on transparency'' Mr. Wol= ak said. As California officials sought to understand why energy prices had= soared out of control he said Enron's ''view was that we want everybody'= s data but if you want ours get a subpoena.''=20 Energy executives and regulators said that sort of arrogance had long marke= d Enron's attitude about government oversight.=20 Electricity sales had for decades been the job of local utility companies = operating as monopolies and selling power at regulated rates within their s= ervice areas. A few entrepreneurs led by Mr. Lay conceived a different mo= del in which power could be sold by generators or middlemen to big corporat= e users or utilities in faraway regions at whatever price the market would= bear.=20 In the early 1990's Congress -- under heavy lobbying by Enron -- passed le= gislation that began to open up electricity sales to marketers. Before long=  Enron became one of the first companies to receive government approval to= sell electricity at market rates. The market for interstate sales of natur= al gas had been freed up a few years earlier and critics complained that t= raders like Enron were gleaning their profits by stoking volatility in gas = prices.=20 In the mid-1990's independent gas producers backed legislation in Congress= to allow the creation of a co-operative marketing organization which the= y hoped would have helped stabilize prices.=20 Raymond Plank the chairman of the Apache Corporation a gas producer based= in Houston said that the big gas marketing and trading companies includi= ng Enron successfully lobbied to kill the plan leaving prices as volatile= as ever.=20 ''It was a great concept'' Mr. Plank said. ''We could have headed off the = problems we have today.''=20 Enron's final lobbying success came last year. With a strong push from the = company's lobbyists Congress passed futures trading legislation that exemp= ted Internet energy trading platforms like EnronOnline the industry leader=  from oversight by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Enron takes t= he other side of trades on its exchange. In traditional markets like the Ne= w York Mercantile Exchange which remain subject to oversight the exchange= acts as a middleman between buyers and sellers.=20 Under Mr. Watson Dynegy has been less of a pathbreaker than Enron and tho= ugh California politicians denounced it too as a profiteer during the ene= rgy crisis most analysts say it has been less aggressive than Enron in bot= h its business practices and its lobbying.=20 Indeed the rival energy-trading executive today predicted ''a huge culture= clash'' as the Houston neighbors merge. ''Blood will flow in Houston over = the integration of the trading operation'' he said.=20 But regulators may find Dynegy easier to deal with.=20 Earlier this year the federal energy commission asked for comments on whet= her it should tighten scrutiny of dealings between natural gas pipelines an= d energy-trading shops owned by the same company.=20 Enron wondered what all the bother was. ''Would stricter rules prevent real= affiliate abuse that current rules do not'' it wrote in a regulatory fili= ng ''or would they instead merely restrict the activities of some of the m= ore successful participants in the marketplace?''=20 Dynegy by contrast painted a grim picture and invited regulators to crack= down. ''Abuses abound'' it said ''because of financial windfalls diffic= ulty of detection lengthy investigations and increased complexity of the m= arket.'' =20 Report on Business: Canadian Dynegy to buy troubled rival Enron Reuter News Agency 11/10/2001 The Globe and Mail=20 Metro B4 All material Copyright (c) Bell Globemedia Publishing Inc. and its licenso= rs.

In only the last month a series of disturbing financial revelations p= ushed to the edge of ruin this once-powerful company whose top executives = had lectured California on its energy foibles and who influenced the direct= ion of national energy policy. Enron muscled its way to the top of the energy heap using aggressive and i= n the end financially suspect strategies that proved its undoing.=20 Now the company that late last year had a market value of $63 billion is w= orth one-tenth that and has agreed to be swallowed by a cross-town competit= or one-quarter its size. Enron's proud and influential chairman and chief e= xecutive Kenneth L. Lay who became a focus of bitter attacks by Californi= a politicians and regulators would lose his job as would many others at E= nron.=20 Even the name would disappear. The combined company would be called Dynegy = Inc. if the deal receives all the necessary regulatory and shareholder appr= ovals.=20 California officials took no joy in Enron's fate Friday though there was p= erhaps some sense of retribution from its many critics in the state.=20 This is basically a rogue corporation said Sen. Steve Peace (D-El Cajon)=  an outspoken critic of Enron for years who dealt with the company as he c= haired the committee that hammered out the legislative portion of Californi= a's landmark electricity deregulation plan in 1996. It has from the beginn= ing been a rogue corporation which answered in its mind to a higher law--a = fundamental belief that there are laws of economics that supersede the law = of the land.=20 A Failed Experiment=20 Steve Maviglio spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis said that although Enron was= never a major force in California's doomed electricity market it was outs= poken in support of deregulation.=20 In a sense their experiment was much like California's experiment--a fail= ure he said.=20 Said Harvey Rosenfield president of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consum= er Rights in Santa Monica: Nothing could better illustrate the disaster of= deregulation than the fact that one of its biggest proponents which reape= d the reward of deregulation is suffering the consequences.=20 Enron is the world's largest energy trader handling one of four energy dea= ls in the United States through its online trading operation EnronOnline. = Since it reported a surprising third-quarter loss on Oct. 16 partly tied t= o shadowy investment vehicles Enron has endured a huge loss of investor co= nfidence which brought on a massive cash crunch and some shrinkage of its = trading business.=20 Under the deal announced Friday Dynegy invited in two weeks ago after Enr= on fell short in its efforts to line up new financing would immediately he= lp Enron by pouring $1.5 billion in cash into the company. The money would = be provided by ChevronTexaco Corp. the San Francisco oil company that owns= nearly 27% of Dynegy.=20 Enron shareholders would get 0.2685 Dynegy share for each Enron share whic= h values the company at about $7.7 billion based on Friday's stock close. D= ynegy shares surged $2.26 to close at $38.76 per share on the New York Stoc= k Exchange Enron added 22 cents to close at $8.63 per share still off 89%= year to date.=20 If the deal closes in six to nine months as the parties expect Dynegy and= ChevronTexaco would invest $1 billion additionally in the combined company= .=20 This is just a financial bonanza really for both companies said Charles = L. Watson Dynegy chairman and chief executive who will head the combined = company. Watson said the merger would immediately add to Dynegy's earnings.= =20 Even so the repercussions of Enron's fall from grace could be far-reaching= . Coming on the heels of California's energy crisis Enron's troubles may s= low the country's march toward energy deregulation which Lay and Enron cha= mpioned for years as a potential boon to consumers and the economy in gener= al.=20 But the deal announced Friday will prevent an even worse outcome energy ex= perts said: the threatened collapse of Enron which would clog up for a tim= e the business of buying and selling electricity natural gas and oil. That= could interfere with delivery of energy around the country they said.=20 This is an encouraging development for the energy industry said Stephen = Baum chairman of Sempra Energy the San Diego-based parent of Southern Cal= ifornia Gas and San Diego Gas & Electric. The Enron-Dynegy combination wil= l create a credit-worthy counter-party which will help preserve order in th= e marketplace. It also will reinforce confidence in the energy trading busi= ness going forward.=20 But some in the industry are less pleased.=20 Raymond Plank chairman of Apache Corp. a Houston-based natural gas explor= ation and development firm said he is considering a motion to the Federal = Trade Commission against the proposed merger.=20 There are issues of concentration in a combination of the largest energy t= rader Enron and the fifth-largest Dynegy Plank said. California shoul= d be particularly concerned because Dynegy owns power plants there and Enro= n has pipelines and other interests.=20 Troubles Mount as Stock Plunges=20 The swagger that was Enron is long gone. Consider:=20 * Enron's brash chief executive Jeffrey K. Skilling touted only months ag= o as one of the young stars of American business abruptly resigned in Augu= st citing personal reasons. Enron's stock already had fallen from its high= of nearly $90 per share as investments in water and telecommunications tur= ned sour a fact that contributed to Skilling's departure.=20 * The Securities and Exchange Commission has launched an investigation of E= nron's controversial dealings with a number of limited partnerships some o= rganized and run by Enron managers including Enron Chief Financial Officer= Andrew S. Fastow who was ousted last month.=20 * In an extraordinary confession Thursday Enron announced that it had over= stated profit by $586 million or 20% during the last five years. The earl= ier financial statements reported to Wall Street and the investing public = Enron said should not be relied upon.=20 * The company also fired its treasurer and a corporate lawyer both of whom= it said were investors in one of the limited partnerships. Yet some analys= ts questioned whether even in its admission of accounting trickery Enron = wasn't still holding something back.=20 * Credit-rating agencies which already have downgraded Enron's bonds to ba= rely above junk status continue to pore over Enron's books. Analysts hav= e said a further downgrade to the level of junk or below investment grade= could precipitate a crisis akin to a run on a bank and threaten Enron's su= rvival while the merger is pending.=20 With its stock crumbling and trading partners leery about its ability to pa= y its debts Enron was forced to walk hat in hand down Houston's Energy All= ey to negotiate a saving takeover by Dynegy the rival once jokingly dismis= sed as Enron Lite.=20 In the trading markets where Enron still holds a leading but increasingly v= ulnerable position other players already are stepping up to grab a bigger = share of the business. Even if Enron's trading operation survives more or l= ess intact under the wing of a Dynegy or some other company experts said = it may never regain its former level of dominance.=20 Enron has been a very innovative shop willing to spend considerably to es= tablish new markets said analyst Andre Meade of Commerzbank Securities in= New York. If that culture is not kept everyone loses.=20 Skilling and mentor Lay had worked for a decade to create both a new kind o= f company and a new set of markets for it to play.=20 In large part they succeeded. Enron transformed itself from a traditional = gas pipeline company into a high-tech global trader of everything from elec= tricity to pollution credits to aluminum. The company's overarching strateg= y was to pare its physical assets to the minimum to get the maximum profit = bang from its intellectual capital: the ranks of MBAs and PhDs that filled = its Houston trading floor.=20 Rather than maintain its own expensive gas fields and power plants--which i= t relegated to stodgy utilities and oil companies--Enron would handle every= thing by contract relying on a network of suppliers to obtain store and d= eliver the goods while the company focused on squeezing out the best price.= =20 Dynegy in contrast has invested in such energy assets including three po= wer plants in Southern California. It uses those assets to back its trading= operation which is much smaller than Enron's.=20 Enron pulled off a migration from the dirty extreme of the oil patch the= asset-intensive domain of drillers and explorers to the clean end wher= e all the deals are done on a computer screen. It also was a migration from= lower profit margins and lower risk to high margins and high risk.=20 Shannon B. Burchett chief executive of Risk Limited Corp. an energy-orien= ted strategic-management consultancy in Dallas compared Enron to the inves= tment bank Salomon Bros. where he used to work in the former PhiBro commod= ities unit.=20 Enron Burchett said embodies a Wall Street culture that happens to be in= Houston.=20 Wall Street certainly got it or thought it did.=20 Accounting Rules Pushed to the Limit=20 At Enron's zenith last year when its stock peaked near $90 a share and it = was pushing into esoteric markets for weather derivatives and fiber-optic b= andwidth Enron seemed to be a one-company wave of the future.=20 Enron's aggressiveness brainpower and willingness to back radical new idea= s with serious capital helped it acquire an aura that in some ways was its = undoing analysts said.=20 Investors accorded Enron's stock a price-to-earnings valuation that was con= sistently higher than those of its peers reflecting the view that its cutt= ing-edge business model could consistently deliver faster-growing profit th= an its competitors.=20 To keep profits arcing ever upward to justify the outsize valuation Enron = began pushing the accounting rules as hard as it pushed competitors in the = trading arena. It acknowledged as much in its statement Thursday conceding= that the operations of three of the limited partnerships should have been = consolidated with Enron's own financial statements instead of being held se= parate.=20 By raising capital and running deals through the limited partnerships Enro= n could keep large amounts of debt and certain volatile assets off its own = balance sheet while simultaneously booking profit from the partnerships' t= ransactions analyst Meade said.=20 Deals Backed by Costly Guarantees=20 One risky aspect of some of Enron's deals through the partnerships was what= Meade called a double-trigger guarantee under which Enron would pledge = a cash payout if either its bond rating fell below investment grade or its = stock declined below a certain price.=20 The guarantees must have seemed a cheap way to sweeten a deal when Enron's = stock was flying high but they came back to haunt the company later when = it had to pay cash to make good on its obligations Meade said.=20 Other energy-trading companies use similar devices but Enron carried it to= an extreme and disclosed too little detail to make the process understanda= ble to investors he said.=20 Enron's magic like that of the Internet-stock phenomenon had never been e= asy to understand in the first place. The company had a reputation among an= alysts for providing scanty financial detail and hard-to-grasp explanations= of some of its dealings.=20 But as long as the reported profit kept climbing Enron kept getting the be= nefit of the doubt.=20 M. Carol Coale a respected Houston-based analyst for Prudential Securities=  ruefully recalled a time last winter when she told Enron she could find = no positive catalyst for the stock and was considering downgrading her inv= estment opinion.=20 Skilling telephoned Coale and asked her to hold off promising her that the= re was unspecified good news on the horizon that would justify her faith.= =20 I believed him Coale said last week in an interview in Houston. She held= her rating steady at that time but has since downgraded Enron to an outrig= ht sell.=20 Instead of Skilling's promised good news questions mounted during the spri= ng and Enron's stock continued a steady decline. Coale and other analysts = were troubled that a large proportion of Enron's earnings seemed to come no= t from its core trading operations but from unusual transactions involving = the company's own stock or that of affiliates.=20 In California Enron played a key role as chief cheerleader for electricity= deregulation and a key energy middleman in the state. As wholesale electri= city prices soared and the state plunged into its energy crisis late last y= ear Enron and other out-of-state electricity generators and traders became= favorite targets of California politicians and regulators who said the co= mpanies were manipulating the market and charging too much for power.=20 But significantly California was not a directly successful territory for E= nron.=20 Markets in water did not develop as Enron subsidiary Azurix envisioned. And= Enron's plans for selling electricity to retail customers were deferred ev= en as deregulation took effect in 1998 because the state's deregulation for= mulas didn't allow room for retail competition.=20 Lay complained about California frequently and met with the governor to try= to influence the state's moves to repair its energy problems. In an interv= iew in his Houston office in January--overlooking Enron's new headquarters = building which is still under construction as the company's name disappear= s--Lay said he and other Enron executives had objected to the way Californi= a regulation was set up.=20 We objected more vehemently than anyone. We opposed the concept of the poo= l he said referring to the now-defunct California Power Exchange in whi= ch most of the state's power was bought and sold in an hourly market. What= competitive market in the world has a pool? We don't buy our groceries thr= ough a centralized PX.=20 Enron also backed away from building a small power plant in California last= year when the state imposed price caps.=20 One of the loudest complaints by Davis and other California officials was t= hat generators of electricity were playing games to get higher prices.=20 They criticized Enron severely too even though it was not a major generat= or because the level of its worldwide trading operations--buying and selli= ng contracts worth billions of dollars in electric power every day--gave En= ron immense sway over pricing and supplies of electricity. They also believ= e that Enron and Lay helped play a part in the reluctance of federal regula= tors for several months to place restraints on the California marketplace.= =20 CEO's Future Role Uncertain=20 Millions of people in California businesses lost money because this rogue = company succeeded in controlling the government of the United States said= state Sen.

Financial Enron Accepts $8 Billion Buyout Offer From Dynegy Energy Giant Was Forced = to Negotiating Table After Disclosing That It Had Overstated Earnings Peter Behr Washington Post Staff Writer 11/10/2001 The Washington Post=20 FINAL E01 Copyright 2001 The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved=20 Embattled Enron Corp. yesterday accepted a buyout offer valued at about $8 = billion from crosstown rival Dynegy Inc. If the deal is completed it would= end Houston-based Enron's reign as the leader in the huge energy trading m= arkets that set the prices of power and natural gas in the nation.=20 Its cash dwindling and its credit rating hammered Enron was forced to the = negotiating table after its recent disclosures that its obligations to a co= mplex web of partnerships involving company officials had caused the tradin= g powerhouse to overstate its earnings and obscure its total debt obligatio= ns. Four top Enron officials have resigned or been replaced since July and= once Dynegy takes control Enron's chairman and chief executive Kenneth L= ay will also leave the company. Lay said yesterday that he had not decided= whether to accept Dynegy's offer to serve on the combined company's board. It's been a good ride for a long time Lay said in a conference call last= night. The last three weeks haven't been a whole lot of fun.=20 The final deal was announced after the close of stock trading. Enron's shar= es -- which had fallen from $33 to $8 after the disclosures -- ended the da= y slightly higher at $8.63. Dynegy's stock closed at $38.76 up $2.26.=20 Dynegy offered all stock for the Enron shares so the total value of the de= al will fluctuate with Dynegy's stock price. Dynegy also said it would assu= me about $13 billion in Enron debt bringing the total value of the transac= tion to around $21 billion.=20 Dynegy's rescue of Enron will begin with an immediate cash infusion of $1.5= billion which will be supplied by ChevronTexaco Corp. a major Dynegy sto= ckholder. ChevronTexaco will invest another $1 billion in Dynegy after the = acquisition has passed regulatory review and is completed which executives= said they expect will take six to nine months as Enron tries to unscramble= the complex partnerships that are now under investigation by the Securitie= s and Exchange Commission.=20 The takeover agreement gives Dynegy an escape clause permitting it to cance= l the purchase if Enron winds up with heavy regulatory fines or legal judgm= ents from shareholder suits tied to its handling of the partnerships.=20 Chuck Watson Dynegy's chairman and chief executive said in the conference= call that a close scrutiny over the past two weeks of Enron's financial co= ndition convinced him that the company's trading and pipeline businesses we= re solid. We looked under the hood and guess what? It looked just as stro= ng as we thought it was. Watson said he did not think more damaging disclo= sures were forthcoming from Enron.=20 Until the partnership mess Enron was the nation's dominant energy trader = and it had front-door political connections to the White House. Lay its lo= ngtime chairman raised more then $100000 for the presidential election ca= mpaign of his friend George W. Bush. Enron rode the growth of energy tradin= g markets beginning in the mid-1990s as first natural gas and then electr= ic power sales were deregulated at the wholesale level. Its revenues leaped= from $9.2 billion in 1995 to $100.8 billion last year.=20 During those heady times the Houston company could choose which questions = to answer about its dealings with related partnerships and its Byzantine bo= okkeeping.=20 It was always very difficult to get information said Louis B. Gagliardi= an analyst with John S. Herold Inc. They would always rebuff you.=20 Until this fall the muscular company seemed too big to stumble said inves= tment manager David Coxe with Harris Insight Equity Fund in Chicago.=20 Coxe bought 78000 shares of Enron at $40 a share in August after wrestlin= g with the decision for months he said. Then Jeffrey Skilling Enron's chi= ef executive and strategic mastermind unexpectedly resigned. The stock wh= ich had been as high as $90 in August 2000 pitched downward.=20 Enron seemed so indispensable to the nation's energy markets that I though= t it inconceivable it could implode Coxe said. That's how I got sucked i= n.=20 Enron's fall is classic hubris Coxe said: a Greek tragedy striking someo= ne who chose to defy the gods -- in this case the rules of the system.= =20 Among the rules that Enron now acknowledges it didn't follow were the accou= nting standards that applied to the complex partnerships it created. The pu= rpose of the partnerships Enron said was to reduce the risks of investmen= ts in Internet transmission systems and to sell power plants and other asse= ts it no longer wanted.=20 The accounting errors were described in a 20-page SEC filing Enron made Thu= rsday. The errors resulted in a $1.2 billion reduction in the value of shar= eholders' equity. The company also said it had overstated its earnings by $= 586 million since 1997.=20 Enron created partnerships that would buy major assets -- such as a power p= lant -- that Enron wanted to sell or in other cases assets such as fiber-= optic cable networks that Enron intended to run but did not want to have on= its balance sheet.=20 The partnerships had outside investors but the general partner of two of t= hem was Enron's own chief financial officer Andrew Fastow. He earned $30 m= illion in fees from managing two of the largest partnerships according to = the SEC document.=20 Enron added to the capital of these partnerships by pledging its stock or = securities convertible into stock. Some of those stock transactions should = have been counted as loans resulting in the $1.2 billion drop in sharehold= er equity Enron now says.=20 Investors are asking why Enron's auditor Arthur Andersen LLP did not insi= st that these transactions be handled that way in the first place. Enron's = SEC filing mentions but does not explain some proposed audit adjustments = over the past four years that were overruled.=20 Even though as Enron now acknowledges it created an information barrier = masking critical information and violating standard accounting rules many = financial analysts who were recommending the stock to investors were not pu= shing hard enough to punch through that barrier some analysts acknowledge.= =20 It was so complicated that everybody was afraid to raise their hands and s= ay 'I don't understand it'  Gagliardi said.=20 The questions are now coming from a new committee reporting to Enron's boa= rd that will investigate how the company's financial reporting was handled= from the SEC and eventually from teams of lawyers representing aggrieve= d shareholders.=20 Lay indicated yesterday he had not been aware until recently that Enron emp= loyees other than Fastow had profited from the partnership activity. Enron = directors had approved Fastow's management of the partnerships but Fastow = quit the partnerships in July and was then replaced as chief financial offi= cer.=20 Enron this week fired Treasurer Ben Glisan and Kristina Mourdant an Enron = division lawyer who it said had invested in partnerships that were tied to= one of the major partnerships headed by Fastow. The Enron report to the SE= C describes a central role in these transactions played by Michael J. Koppe= r an associate of Fastow who left Enron in July to take over Fastow's fina= ncial interests in the partnership the company said.=20 Enron will hold a conference call next week to discuss what it has uncovere= d about outside partnership investments. http://www.washingtonpost.com Financial Desk The Nation NEWS ANALYSIS A Visionary Fallen From Grace JAMES FLANIGAN TIMES STAFF WRITER 11/10/2001 Los Angeles Times=20 Home Edition A-22 Copyright 2001 / The Times Mirror Company=20 A year ago Enron Corp. Chairman Kenneth L. Lay was on top of the energy wo= rld. As a leading fund-raiser contributor and energy advisor to the Bush a= dministration he played a key role in shaping the new president's energy p= olicy. As head of the world's largest energy trading company he had an eno= rmous influence on the price of energy in California and across the nation.= Enron's highflying stock helped him cash out $123 million in stock options= last year alone.=20 On Friday with Enron being saved from financial collapse by agreeing to be= acquired by rival Dynegy Inc. Lay's career and reputation are in shambles= . Under the merger he will be stripped of a management job. His integrity = is tattered with Enron's controversial financial dealings under federal in= vestigation. Enron investors and employees are chagrined and outraged becau= se the company's stock lost 80% of its value in recent weeks. The rapid rise and fall of Lay 58 is a story of how a brilliant man with = innovative ideas and a grand scheme to transform the world's energy markets= was overcome with arrogance associates and critics say. Under Lay Enron = stretched the limits of the law and took risks that nearly caused its finan= cial collapse they say. That in turn could have resulted in a widespread d= isruption in energy supplies.=20 Enron's behavior casts doubt on the integrity of our financial markets. It= is a very serious matter said Edward R. Muller an energy investor and f= ormer president of Edison International's Mission Energy subsidiary.=20 Nobody denies he's smart but it's a question of integrity said Raymond = Plank chief executive of Apache Corp. and an associate of Lay's in Houston= 's vibrant oil and gas industry.=20 Lay and longtime partner Jeffrey K. Skilling who served briefly as Enron's= chief executive before resigning abruptly in August rose to prominence in= the last decade through the use of innovative financial techniques designe= d to exploit a reduction in government regulation of energy.=20 Lay transformed world energy industries through his vision of new market-d= riven ways to finance natural gas and electricity production and transmissi= on.=20 The financial markets that Lay and his Enron associates created had an enor= mous effect on California's disastrous experiment in electricity deregulati= on. Critics say his influence was excessive and misguided.=20 Ken Lay was a mystic said state Sen. Steve Peace (D-El Cajon) an outspo= ken critic of Enron. Whatever he said had to make sense because he was Ken= Lay. It was hero worship. Many of the people working as economists at the = Federal Energy Regulatory Commission worshiped Ken Lay. As a consequence t= he things Enron promoted and pushed for were never challenged intellectual= ly and otherwise.=20 Lay who has a doctorate in economics had modest beginnings as the son of = a poor country preacher who did farm labor on the side to raise money for h= is children's education. In the Navy in the late 1960s Lay was assigned to= the Defense Department because of his economic acumen. He allocated Penta= gon dollars more efficiently in purchasing for the military said Mark Pal= mer chief spokesman for Enron.=20 Lay worked for Exxon and other energy firms in the 1970s amid soaring oil = prices gasoline shortages and still-regulated natural gas. He headed Houst= on Natural Gas a predecessor firm of Enron in the 1980s as falling prices= for oil and natural gas presented grave problems for Houston's energy indu= stries.=20 When the federal government allowed pipelines to carry the gas of any produ= cer Lay turned Enron into a foremost firm in the new deregulated industry= . Still Enron almost went bankrupt in the late 1980s with natural gas in = oversupply and prices falling.=20 It was then that Skilling a McKinsey & Co. consultant suggested to Lay th= at the firm trade long-term contracts for gas promising to deliver the com= modity to customers at fixed prices buying and selling contracts of varyin= g maturities the way mortgage companies deal with mortgages in Skilling'= s words.=20 The innovation started Enron's rapid growth and rise to prominence as the e= mbodiment of a new kind of energy company. In the 1990s the federal govern= ment called for deregulation of electricity.=20 Lay saw opportunities. He and Skilling created a market for contracts in el= ectricity in 1994 and by 1996 Enron was the world's leading firm doing suc= h business.=20 Lay's central idea was that by creating a market of millions of buyers and= sellers constantly taking positions power supplies could be allocated eff= iciently and prices lowered. Lay liked to lecture in an avuncular way abo= ut the new economics of energy trading.=20 Technology is changing and there's a lot more value in flexibility and op= tionality. Just about in every industry you can make them a lot more effic= ient when you have more optionality Lay said in an interview in January i= n his Houston offices overlooking the sparkling new Enron headquarters buil= ding which still is under construction.=20 As Enron's business profile grew so did Lay's political influence. He serv= ed as an energy advisor to both Bush administrations and headed Texas fund-= raising for George W. Bush's presidential campaign. Lay raised $100000 for= the Bush-Cheney campaign and with his wife Linda Lay contributed anothe= r $100000 to help finance the inaugural gala this year.=20 As the administration prepared its energy plan Lay gained national stature= as a preacher of market economics applied to electricity.=20 There's no way you can centralize a command-control environment and make t= he best decisions to have an efficient low-cost reliable electricity indu= stry Lay said.=20 His sermon was intended for California which suffered sharply higher price= s for electricity last winter to the point that private utilities fell int= o or near bankruptcy and the state budget incurred a cost of $12 billion w= hich Sacramento now is trying to recover through the sale of revenue bonds.= =20 Because Enron trading billions of dollars a day in power contracts worldwi= de had an immense effect on electricity prices Lay's preaching grated on = state officials. Driven to intemperance state Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer said= in May that he'd like to escort Lay to a prison cell.=20 But more than economic philosophy was behind Lay's goading of California. T= he state's debacle gave energy deregulation a bad name and chilled deregula= tion moves by many other states.=20 That in turn reduced growth prospects for Enron. The promise of continued g= rowth in deregulation had helped make Enron a Wall Street darling. Its stoc= k price at one point nearly $90 a share versus less than $10 now pushed u= p the value of Enron stock options held by almost all employees but owned = in great amounts by Lay Skilling and other company officers.=20 Lay cashed in last year converting options for a gain of $123 million whi= le Skilling gained $62 million by converting his options. As they cashed in=  Enron was encountering other problems. Attempts to set up trading markets= in water and broadband Internet transmission were floundering. A major pow= er plant venture in India was in grave economic and political trouble.=20 But in the last month Enron revealed that it had reduced the firm's equity= value by more than $1 billion due to write-offs in a hitherto hidden partn= ership.=20 Revelations then cascaded. The firm had 33 such partnerships which had bil= lions of dollars in debt for which Enron was liable. Lay and Skilling piled= up debt in hidden partnerships analysts explain because the firm needed = huge amounts of debt to support its greatly expanding levels of trading in = electricity natural gas and other commodities.=20 But the firm could not support such debt and still retain its credit rating=  growth rate and high stock price. After weeks of gamely protesting that t= he business was sound and that he personally took offense at investment ana= lysts' suggestions of impropriety Lay fell silent.=20 *=20 Times staff writer Nancy Vogel in Sacramento contributed to this report.

Wabash has filed an appeal in the DC Circuit of AEP/CSW merger (its brief is due 11/20). He thinks FERC is out of control and not carrying on its duties. Wabash is also preparing a protest of the Alliance compliance filing (due this Friday 10/6) on the following grounds: Filing is really a continuation of pancaking Does not want FERC to approve on a conditional basis (expecting Alliance to be a true RTO)--Wabash thinks that Alliance simply creates a larger profit center for AEP's transmission system Mr. Morton also had some specific OASIS problem examples that happened to Wabash that involved preferential treatment for AEP. I told him to call or email Scott Miller for the investigation. Mr. Morton and Wabash CEO Ed Martin would like to come to Houston to visit with Enron about our concerns and about the possibility of making some joint filings. His number is 317-481-2815.

1049,Privileged and Confidential -- Performance Bonus Language,David You asked me to provide my opinion about the employment agreement provisions relating to target bonus amounts that are based on performance. The bonus language contained in the majority of the agreements with a target bonus is as follows: Provided that Enron meets its earnings targets and provided that Employee is rated within the top 25% of the performance criteria under Enron's annual performance rating system or its equivalent for the calendar year in question Employee's annual bonus amounts under the Plan for calendar years 2001 2002 and 2003 (payable in 2002 2003 and 2004 respectively) shall be based on an annual bonus target of $_____________. This language does not address a person's performance as compared to one's peers but instead looks at the number of performance criteria and requires that a person be in the top 25% of those criteria. Thus if there are only 3 rating categories (i.e. 1 2 3 distributed as 10-80-10) then only the people in the top category would be within the top 25/33% of the rating criteria. Given the huge change in our process however there is an argument that the above language cannot be applied to the current scheme and that instead we should look at the top 25% of the peer group instead of performance criteria even though that was not the intent of the provision when it was drafted. As a result I would suggest that the middle category be divided further into either 2 or 3 subcategories (i.e. 2A 2B or 2C). That way persons who fall out in categories 1 or 2A would be eligible for the target bonus. If there is a decision not to break down the middle 80 further then it would be useful to look at those employees with a bonus target that we think is too high. For those employees a more conservative approach may be to evaluate them on a scale that is more subdivided than the 10-80-10 breakdown and to document that they fell out in the bottom 75% of the categories under that process. Of course it goes without saying that we should ensure consistent treatment based on race sex national origin age etc. in this process. Please let me know if you have any questions.,"Performance Bonus; Employment Agreement

I am less certain about the direction FERC will go on pricing since even the staff has recognized stumbling blocks in their own recommendation and offers possible variants. The ISO has not submitted revised tariff sheets for approval yet so it is unlikely they would try to implement their own plan in the near term. If they try to do so without FERC approval possible legal avenues might include the filing of a complaint at FERC asking for fast track processing (this fast is measured in weeks not days) and/or seeking injunctive relief in court (faster) which can be hard to obtain but not impossible depending entirely on the circumstances.

Charles does make a good point about the deference language. As written FERC has discretion to defer to NERC or an RTO to monitor and enforce compliance. At a minimum that language should be expanded to include another entity like an EISB. Similarly the language should probably be tweaked to allow FERC to adopt standards of an organization other than NERC. ,"Energy; FERC; NERC; Reliability

1085,RE: FERC rulemaking on Generator Interconnection,Jim -- The quick answer to your question on the Barton bill is that yes it does = appear to address this tax issue involving interconnections at least in pa= rt. There is language in Title VIII on various tax issues. One of them ex= ludes from gross income certain amounts received by electric utilities spe= cifically including connection fees. In the example in the e-mail the iss= ue was not fees paid directly but assets paid for by the generator that ar= e then transferred to the utility. Will check on that angle. In any event Title VIII (while in the Barton bill) is not in the jurisdict= ion of Barton's subcommittee. Instead the tax title would have to go thro= ugh the Ways and Means Committee. There were some energy tax provisions in= the House-passed energy bill last August. Chris and I will consult tomorr= ow to see if this issue was included in that bill. Aside from the tax issue Barton bill would require the type of interconnec= tion rulemaking that FERC is now conducting (both for connections to local = distribution and to transmission). In each case the cost of interconnecti= on would have to be comparable to what the utility charges others similarly= situated. I will go back to double check but off the top of my head I re= call that the Bingaman draft specifically socializes the costs of interco= nnection. John ,"Energy; FERC; Taxes; Legislation

In the Stip we argue that PJM should be approved by FERC but condition our acceptance on a FERC process to unify the Northeast markets. My only comment is to delete the final WHEREAS paragraph on congestion management. While our ability to later stop PJM from being an RTO is limited I believe that this gives us the ability to drive a consolidation of the Northeast markets - which is one of the goals of the East Power desk. In addition I think that the overall direction of PJM in commercializing its software is a good activity for our interest - even if we don't want everything in their package.

While there is always some value in these things it is ususally quite small and consumes more valuable resources in trying to capture the benefit than the benefit itself. From: Michael B Rosen@ECT on 07/13/2001 08:44 AM To: Steven J Kean/NA/Enron@Enron cc: Subject: A&M - Bush Library Foundation & School of Public Policy Steve- We have been approached by the Texas A&M/George Bush Presidential Library Foundation and School of Public Policy to endow additional funds. Enron had made an original contribution to the library foundation back in 1998 totaling $250K over five years. I am working with Community Relations and A/A Recruiting to evaluate the latest request and to discuss where Enron may have interest or find leverage for our Government Affairs Recruiting or PR efforts. The Foundation is willing to work with us to establish whatever type of program(s) and/or participatory involvement we would like. We have discussed an Enron speaker series classroom lectures advisory committee seats and the likes. I have already had a chance to run this by Rick Shapiro and Rob Bradley. Although Rick was noncommittal regarding his team's time for speaking or lecturing he seemed supportive of the effort.

1102,California Public Affairs Strategy,To make sure that Enron is not missing any opportunities to make our points on competition we need to develop some key message points and facts. My understanding is that the key story line is that COMPETITION IS WORKING AND SHOULD BE PUSHED FORWARD. We need to be able to give examples of what is happening - deregulation customers are winning. For example our CSU customers are just fine even with higher energy markets. I think that are some key questions that we need to consider when we put these together: Who is the audience? My answer - California policymakers key stakeholders FERC federal government. Can we use this in the FERC Investigation on Markets? My answer - we have to California is too big and important not realize that California will play a role in FERC's discussions. What is the timing of message? My answer - Wherever and whenever needs to be coordinated. This CA legislative process (next 2.5 weeks) may be a possibility. FERC Investigation. Taking the story nationally is good if we have the facts from CA. Who will deliver the message? My answer - Everyone on the Enron team needs to have the same message all of the time. We can't let any opportunity pass us by. Do we demonize the utilities? My answer - if necessary we just need to make sure that we have as many facts to prove our points if we do attack. How do we prove that rolling back to regulation is ridiculous? My answer - retain LEGC to develop the hypothetical of what would have happened? NEEDS TO BE DISCUSSED INTERNALLY - LEGC MAY NOT BE THAT FRIENDLY.

1125,"Report on ""Anti-RTO Bill"" and on Andy Black Meeting",This note is to report on two electricity legislative developments: the Aug. 2nd introduction of an anti-RTO bill (or at least anti-mandatory RTOs) and on a meeting I had yesterday afternoon with Andy Black the policy coordinator for Chairman Joe Barton on the House Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee to discuss their intentions with respect to electricity legislation this Fall. 1. H.R. 2814 (Reps. Tom Sawyer (D-OH) and Richard Burr (R-NC)) On Aug. 2nd (the last day Congress was in session before the August Recess) the above named members of the House Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee introduced H.R. 2814 the Interstate Transmission Act. The legislation is bad because among other things it requires FERC to establish transmission pricing policies that provide incentives for voluntary participation and formation of RTOs with language prohibiting policies that have the effect of forcing transmitting utilities to join RTOs. Also objectionable is that the bill would limit pancaking but at the same time require FERC to establish a reasonable transition mechanism or period for additive charges. The legislation prohibits FERC from conditioning any order upon a transmitting utility being required to transfer operational control of jurisdictional facilities to an ISO or RTO. The bill would require that participating transmitting utilities must approve the form structure and operating entity of any RTO. In addition to the RTO language the bill has the old version of the NERC reliability legislation in it. The bill also has a PUHCA exemption for RTOs repeals Federal Power Act sec. 203 on the disposition of property and includes the tax changes that IOUs seek for transfers of property to an independent transmission company. Barbara Hueter advises that First Energy has its hq in Rep. Sawyer's district. Rep. Burr is from North Carolina so perhaps Duke had its utility hat on in working with him. I am checking into where Duke is on this issue. Rep. Burr is the Vice Chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee and close to Chairman Tauzin -- so his support for this legislation is significant (see Andy Black comment below). 2. Andy Black Meeting Andy is meeting with various trade associations this month to discuss electricity legislation. He is only meeting with a few companies on a one-on-one basis -- Enron Reliant Dynegy and TXU. His timing is to have a legislative draft for Chairman Barton to review when Congress returns after Labor Day. If Chairman Barton approves or makes changes the draft will be circulated to members of the subcommittee and the public for further comment. The intent is to mark up an electricity bill this Fall so that if the Senate acts on electricity in its comprehensive energy bill the issue will be ripe for consideration in a House-Senate conference committee. Here is a run down of my comments and Andy's comments on specific issues. a. RTOs Chairman Barton supports RTOs. At a minimum the draft will affirm FERC's authority as the commissioners have requested. Andy is considering going beyond that to mandate RTO participation. Not sure he can hold that position in the subcommittee. He is looking to Enron and others to help them explain and build support for RTOs. Informed him of our initial informal coalition steps. However Andy asked me to look at sec. 3 of the Sawyer-Burr referenced above which I realized after the meeting is the part that deals with incentive rates and negotiated rates to expand transmission and voluntary RTOs. I have a call in to Andy to reconcile these statements since the Sawyer-Burr bill is based on voluntary RTOs. Hopefully he is thinking of using the incentive and negotiated rate language and NOT the objectionable voluntary RTO aspects. I will strongly encourage him to do the right thing in that regard. b. PUHCA The draft will use the Pickering bill (H.R. 1101). Told Andy about our concerns with the record keeping provisions of that bill. Will send him our legislative language to clarify these provisions so that they do not open up all of Enron's records -- even those unrelated to transactions with a regulated utility affiliate. c. PURPA Prospective repeal. On back up power they are thinking of requiring that rates for back up power be just and reasonable until there is retail competition in the state. d. Interconnection They have received a proposal from Trigen that Andy says we will like. I am contacting EPSA to get the details. e. Net Metering They are likely to include the Inslee bill to require net metering. I explained our concern that the bill's mandate applies to all retail energy suppliers -- including EES -- even though this should only apply to utilities with an obligation to serve that it does not make sense to mandate it on service providers like EES (per Jim's helpful comments yesterday). I need to get more information to Andy. f. Transmission Jurisdiction Thankfully Andy is NOT going to use those portions of the bill as reported by subcommittee in the last Congress that gave use heart burn on jurisdiction. Specifically the draft will not say FERC does not have jurisdiction over the transportation component of a bundled retail sale -- the draft will not get into the bundled/unbundled issue at all. The draft will bring munis co-ops and PMAs under the FERC umbrella for transmission jurisdiction purposes. g. Siting On siting Andy is thinking of some type of mechanism that would give a State one year before federal eminent domain attaches. h. Reliability On a negative note Andy intends to use the latest NERC reliability language because NERC's version has strong support among the Members of the subcommittee and no other alternative has emerged with political support (i.e. not PJM). I explained our concerns. He said our best bet is for DoE or FERC to come forward to seek something other than the NERC version. He said Members eyes glaze over on reliability with everything else on the plate. i. Negawatts I raised the absence of negawatts on his issue list. He said he is open to considering it again but that there was left over political baggage and unresolved issues from when this was attempted during consideration of the California bill earlier this summer. Your questions and comments on the any of the above are most welcome.,"Energy; Legislation; RTOs; FERC; NERC; Utilities

TERRIE JAMES@ENRON COMMUNICATIONS 07/05/2001 01:09 PM To: Steven J Kean/NA/Enron@Enron cc: Subject: Funky Business Steve Have you had a chance to look at the book Funky Business and to give any thought to having Jonas present at the Management Conference? I know you have a thousand other things on your plate not the least of which is California so I understand if the answer is no. However they've been contacted by someone else about the date so we may be forced to decide rather soon. On a related subject I'm contemplating another topic for the conference. I'd seen an article in Fortune several months ago titled Managing for the Slowdown. It talked about new challenges managers face in light of the economic downturn. (Most young managers have never experienced anything but boom times.) The article also outlines a dozen or so things companies should be thinking about now. (Use the downturn as a new opportunity to evaluate people. Overhaul your budget process.

I'm still awaiting additional suggestions from anyone on speakers. I guess Lee's e-mail changes things. If the business school wants to go forward with a conference anyway then it may be a bad idea to have a separate one. Jeff has said he likes the idea of coordinating. Bill and Allen what do you think? I will chime in that Carl Shapiro is very much a big wig as a former chief economist at DOJ. As for the Frank Wolak suggestion Frank is a Stanford economist who is an outstanding analyst and has published probably more than anyone else on electricity market design performance regarding the UK Australia and California. He speaks a mile a minute though and his understanding of policy and politics is a bit naive. I should note that ICF will not be able to contribute. I heard from Michael Berg this morning.

Toshiba is uniting digital mobile and network innovations in a bold new vision of Information Technology for today and tomorrow. Take a closer look at life in the new Digital Age. And imagine how good IT can be. Visit Toshiba.com for more details. The Real Wolf RECKONINGS By PAUL KRUGMAN ecently I received a letter from an economist I respect chiding me for my Naderite columns on the California energy crisis. He just didn't believe that market manipulation by power companies could possibly be an important issue it sounded too much to him like the sort of thing one hears from knee-jerk leftists who blame greedy capitalists for every problem be it third-world poverty or high apartment rents. The left has cried Wolf! so many times that sensible people have learned to discount such claims. But now a bona fide wolf has arrived whose predatory behavior is doing terrible damage to our most populous state - and nobody will believe it. True California would be heading for a summer of power shortages even if it had never deregulated. And even if there was workable competition in the wholesale electricity market prices in that market would spike during periods of peak demand transferring billions of dollars from either taxpayers or consumers to the generators. But the evidence is now overwhelming that there isn't workable competition in California's power market and that the actions of generators gaming the system have greatly magnified the crisis. The key fact is that California has somehow remained in a state of more or less continuous power shortage and very high wholesale prices regardless of the level of demand. A rash of outages has kept the electricity market conveniently - and very profitably - short of supply even during periods of low demand when there ought to be lots of excess capacity. As Frank Wolak the Stanford economist who also advises the state's power grid has pointed out an outage at a power plant is a lot like an employee calling in sick. You can't tell directly whether he is really sick or has chosen to take the day off for other reasons but you can look for circumstantial evidence. And such evidence has convinced Mr. Wolak that generators use forced outages strategically to withhold capacity from the market - a view shared by a growing number of other researchers. Which brings us to the latest move by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. On Wednesday the commission apparently decided to offer California some relief and put new price caps in place on the California electricity market. I say apparently because the more you look at the plan the less likely it seems to be any help at all. Indeed the measure was passed on a 2-to-1 vote with William Massey - the one commissioner who has been sympathetic to calls for price controls - voting against it on the grounds that it would be ineffectual. What's wrong with FERC's plan? First it caps prices only in emergency conditions - ignoring the fact that electricity prices have stayed at hard- to-explain levels even when there is no emergency. In effect the plan is laid out as if the electricity market were really competitive in spite of all the evidence that it is not. Second even those emergency price caps are full of loopholes offering extensive opportunities for what Mr. Wolak calls megawatt laundering - selling power to affiliated companies that for one reason or another are exempted from the price controls (for example the controls do not apply to imports from neighboring states) then selling it back into the California market. Severin Borenstein of the University of California Energy Institute adds that because the allowed price depends on the cost of generation at the least efficient plant generators will have a clear incentive to produce inefficiently: I predict we will find some plants we never heard of before that are suddenly operating again and they will be pretty inefficient. The general verdict seems to be that this is not a serious plan. There are serious proposals to mitigate the crisis out there - indeed last fall Mr. Wolak submitted a proposal that was well received by other experts - but FERC has ignored all of them. The charitable interpretation is that FERC still doesn't get it that it just can't bring itself to believe that this time the wolf is real. The uncharitable interpretation is that last week's action was meant to fail. The Medley Report an online newsletter calls the FERC plan a grand exercise in posturing without substance . . . a very clever temporary move by the Bush administration to deflect any political fallout from the looming disaster. Whatever the explanation the plain fact is that FERC and the administration have yet to offer California any significant relief.

1169,RTO Meeting With Chairman Barton,Late yesterday afternoon EPSA's legislative affairs committee (about 10 of us) met with Chairman Barton and staff to discuss his draft RTO language. Meeting lasted 45 minutes. Interestingly no one was there from either Reliant or El Paso. We had what the diplomats would call a frank exchange of views. Can't say we moved Barton very much if at all except we did have a chance to go over the staff to point out specific flaws in the draft even based on his view of how RTOs should come about (I gave several very specific examples like the 40000 MW provision and other limits on FERC discretion on size and scope as well as procedural rights for transmission owners but not the rest of us etc.). Chairman Barton's fundamental view is that Congress not FERC should determine how RTOs come about. And that the market and the industry should determine how RTOs are shaped etc. not FERC. He bristled at one point and said he had more faith in us than he had in FERC or we had in ourselves to determine how RTOs come about going so far as to saying that under his draft they would be our RTOs -- meaning those of us present. I pointed out this is wrong because under his draft the transmission owners particularly those least likely to join up would have all the leverage. I said that the basic flaw in the draft is that it assumes there are only two parties to the transaction -- FERC and transmission owners -- forgetting the rest of us including consumers. He said we could become transmission owners if we wanted to!!! On the 40000 MW size minimum he said many experts had advised them this is the correct number. We said that putting a number in to the statute ran counter to his oft-stated desire for a fair process to produce RTOs driven by market forces not regulators. The two elements of good news -- Barton reconfirmed that a markup this year is very unlikely AND he expressed that he would not spend too much time on electricity next year if it started to crowd out other issues like Clean Air Act Amendments and nuclear waste legislation. This suggests a strategy possibility in terms of running out the clock. He said he has the votes by a wide margin to report the RTO draft but will entertain some changes. He said the only reason he has not marked up the bill is that the Sept. 11th terrorist attacks have taken attention away from the issue and subcommittee members are not engaged on the issue. He said those of us who support could roll the dice with them but that there are things that only Congress can do -- like getting all transmission owners into RTOs -- and that these statutory changes are so important that we should not oppose the draft.,"Energy Policy; RTOs; Congress; FERC; Transmission Owners

Gray Davis by a mid-August deadline. A group of legislators and Davis staffers has worked this week on an agreement that would restore Southern California Edison's credit and relieve the state of having to purchase energy for the utility. Assembly leaders who convened the group set an ambitious schedule that would have led to a vote today had they reached consensus and been able to recall enough of the 80 Assembly members from summer recess destinations. But the newly formed plan which would issue $2.9 billion in consumer-backed bonds in exchange for several Edison concessions remains too rough for a vote said Paul Hefner a spokesman for Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg D-Sherman Oaks. Hefner was quick to note that Hertzberg has the Assembly on call for the scheduled monthlong break and is prepared to ask members to return if a deal comes in the next three weeks. But staff and lawmakers said earlier that organizing a mass return after today would prove nearly impossible because Assembly members are expected to travel throughout the state and beyond. Davis set an Aug. 15 deadline in his original Edison deal and recently said he could call a special session forcing legislators to return if they do not authorize a plan by then. His spokesman Steven Maviglio said Thursday the governor is not ruling out that idea but is waiting to see what comes of further legislative discussions. It's pretty clear that everyone's working pretty hard to form a consensus but they're just not there Maviglio said. The governor is optimistic about the Aug. 15 date. Even so Edison does not expect a solution by then. Company officials stated earlier this week that they would wait for a political deal at least until lawmakers return Aug. 20.

Rose UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER July 27 2001 Sempra Energy the parent company of SDG&E reported a 25 percent surge in profit to $137 million last quarter but said yesterday it lost money on the sale of electricity under a long-term contract to California. On the other hand Sempra said its largest source of profits was its energy trading unit a middleman that earned $69 million during the quarter buying and selling energy produced by others. The results underscore the transformation of relatively simple utility companies into diversified energy holding companies that have learned to profit in new ways from the deregulation of electricity and the turmoil in energy markets. The surprising announcement -- that a company lost money selling power during California's run-up in electricity prices -- was explained by Sempra as an intentional consequence of the long-term contract it signed with the state to provide power. Stephen Baum chairman and chief executive officer of Sempra said the company agreed to provide a steep discount to California during the summer months but would recoup the losses later in the 10-year deal. California sought long-term electricity purchase contracts so it could reduce its purchases in daily and near-term power markets where prices reached record levels. Critics say Gov. Gray Davis rushed into long-term deals because of concerns about getting through next year's election. They also say the contracts will saddle customers with higher costs for years. The governor has acknowledged that long-term contracts might cause consumers to pay relatively high prices for electricity in later years but he maintains it is a fair price to pay for lowering prices that were devastating the state economy. Michael Shames executive director of the Utility Consumers' Action Network in San Diego said the steep discount Sempra provided to the state on power this summer raised questions about the governor's proposal to help San Diego Gas & Electric Co. clear a debt of $750 million. SDG&E says it is owed that money for power purchases on behalf of its customers. In a media conference last month Davis said the agreement would eliminate the threat of a possible balloon payment for consumers who he said might have faced the so-called balancing account debt as early as next year. Shames says the proposal which took the form of a memorandum of understanding or MOU is costly for consumers and a bonanza for Sempra. He said the relatively cheap power provided by Sempra this summer makes the MOU sound like more of a hidden payback to Sempra than a real relief plan for local ratepayers. Shames said he will release an analysis of the state's Sempra plan next week. The state Public Utilities Commission is expected to rule on the plan in August. A Sempra spokesman said there is no connection between discount power and the tentative agreement to clear the $750 million debt. Doug Kline the Sempra spokesman said the power contract with the state was signed in early May and the agreement on the balancing account was reached in mid-June. Sempra Energy Trading meanwhile said only 10 percent of its $69 million profit was earned from sales of energy in the western region which includes California. The trading operation earned $40 million in profit during the comparable period last year. California's Independent System Operator which manages most of the state power grid and other investigators have said trading and bidding strategies were tools used by energy companies to raise prices during the California power crisis. Though Sempra earned money on trading its wholesale power generating business lost $9 million during the quarter. Baum said the discounts on electricity provided the state were the prime cause of the loss for Sempra Energy Resources but added that a plant outage also contributed. Sempra Energy Resources which co-owns a generating plant near Las Vegas with Reliant Energy earned $2 million during the second quarter last year. Baum added that Sempra's long-term contract with the state -- under which it will provide up to 1900 megawatts -- has allowed its wholesale business to pre-sell about half the power it expects to generate from the Nevada plant which will be expanded and three generating facilities it expects to build. Profits at SDG&E slipped to $37 million during the quarter ended June 30 down from $40 million last year according to Sempra. SDG&E whose business is restricted to delivering gas and electricity said it provided increased customer service during the crisis which lowered profits. Wall Street analysts generally applauded Sempra's results noting that the company was ahead of its plan to generate at least a third of its profits from its newer businesses by 2003. They're really two years ahead of schedule for their non-utility businesses said Brian Youngberg an analyst with Edward Jones & Co. Bud Leedom a San Diego-based analyst with Wells Fargo Van Kasper said Sempra's move into energy trading now seems shrewd. We never dreamed they were setting themselves for a windfall like this Leedom said. Investors pushed Sempra shares up 17 cents yesterday to close at $25.49 in trading on The New York Stock Exchange.

Smog Rules May Be Eased Power plants: EPA proposes a sweeping change in how utilities' emissions are curbed a flexible approach favored by the industry. By GARY POLAKOVIC and ELIZABETH SHOGREN Times Staff Writers July 27 2001 WASHINGTON -- U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Christie Whitman proposed sweeping changes Thursday in the regulation of power plant pollution that would replace five of the government's toughest programs with a single flexible approach favored by utilities. Whitman outlined a plan for cleaning up major components of power plant smog that represents a significant departure from the EPA's traditional regulatory dictums. She called for a major expansion of pollution credit trading which up to now has had varying success. Under the new plan the EPA would scrap some of the most stringent measures devised by the agency to deal with power plant emissions. One provision to be set aside aims to cut harmful mercury emissions another is meant to reduce emissions from Midwestern power plants by 85% another is designed to restore visibility at national parks. Especially unpopular with industry one measure known as new source review requires the installation of advanced pollution controls whenever power plants are expanded or modified. It too would be phased out. New source review is certainly one of those regulatory aspects that would no longer be necessary Whitman told Sen. George Voinovich (R-Ohio) at the hearing by the Environment and Public Works Committee. All of those [programs] could be aligned into one regulatory process that she said would work better than existing rules. Whitman's comments offer the first peek into the administration's plans for cleaning some of the dirtiest polluters left in the nation. Debate over the administration's clean-air approach has shifted to Congress as it considers whether to revise the national Clean Air Act. The magnitude of the proposed revisions caught environmentalists by surprise but buoyed industry representatives who say existing controls are costly and inefficient. She has raised an appalling prospect of junking virtually every rule and strategy to deal with emissions of electric companies in return for some vague industry-sought plan for an emissions trading scheme said Frank O'Donnell executive director of the Clean Air Trust an environmental advocacy group. If they go forward with this it means a wholesale fight over the Clean Air Act in Congress. After the hearing Whitman stressed that the overall goal is to clean the air more efficiently than current rules do. Although the administration has not yet released a so-called multipollutant cleanup strategy Whitman contended that collapsing several regulations into one far-reaching approach would be easier for regulators and industry to manage. What we're looking for is targets under this legislation that significantly clean up the air beyond what our current regulatory statutory requirements would do Whitman said. She added that new source review for example could potentially be no longer necessary if you have the right kind of targets set in a multi-emissions bill. We have to wait and see where the targets are set. Utilities have lobbied Vice President Dick Cheney's energy task force to prevent the EPA from aggressively enforcing the new source review regulation. Industry and administration officials say the provision is onerous and prevents plant upgrades although EPA officials say it is a key tool for forcing dirty old plants to cut emissions by up to 95%. During the Clinton administration federal officials charged that 32 coal-fired power plants in several Southern and Midwestern states ignored a requirement that companies install advanced emission controls when their plants were upgraded. The government reached settlement with three utilities but a provision in the Bush administration's energy plan stalled those enforcement actions pending a review of power plant controls. C. Boyden Gray attorney for the Electric Reliability Coordinating Council and former White House counsel for the first President Bush in the 1980s praised the administration's proposal. He said major utility companies he represents including Southern Co. Duke Energy Co. and the Tennessee Valley Authority could clean up with greater flexibility and less cost under the plan outlined by Whitman. To put everything in a market-incentives basis is a great step. It would be a real breakthrough and a plus for the business community Gray said. For example Gray said EPA has four separate measures to control nitrogen oxides from power plant combustion including programs to cut acid rain ozone and haze. Another program scheduled to take effect in May 2004 requires power plants in 19 states to cut summer emissions by 1 million tons annually. He said those programs can be confusing and costly and could easily be replaced by a credit-trading program run largely by power companies. Under the program being considered by the Bush administration an emission limit could be established at hundreds of power plants followed by annual reductions in mercury a toxic metal as well as smog-forming nitrogen and sulfur oxides. However a provision to reduce carbon dioxide a gas implicated in global warming was dropped under industry pressure. Power companies that reduce beyond their limits could sell emission credits which represent a pound of pollution to companies that exceed their limits. Although industry and free-market advocates favor such programs they are not without controversy. The record of market-driven programs is mixed. On the one hand the nation's acid rain program uses marketable permits and is widely credited with cutting sulfur oxides at less cost. On the other hand the world's first market-driven program to tackle urban smog has not worked in Los Angeles where nearly 400 power companies and manufacturers failed to achieve significant cleanup for the nearly eight years the program has been in effect. Further many environmental groups are wary of market-driven programs because by design they preclude active government intervention. Critics say such programs could potentially limit public review of power plant operations allow emissions to concentrate in poor communities and slow efforts to cut haze in national parks downwind from plants that elect to buy pollution credits instead of cleaning up. The Bush administration's power plant strategy was aired before the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee which is chaired by Sen. James M. Jeffords (I-Vt.) whose dramatic departure from the GOP threw control of the Senate to the Democrats. Jeffords is proposing legislation different from the administration's approach that would control four power plant pollutants including the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide an approach rejected by the Bush administration. Prospects appear to be increasing that Congress will pass one or more measures designed to reduce carbon dioxide emissions a belated response to this week's decision by more than 180 countries to deal with the problem without the involvement of the United States. Indeed in recent weeks several members in the GOP-led House and Democratic Senate have voted on bills with the intention of disassociating themselves from President Bush's environmental policies before the next election. Among the votes the House struck down a provision supported by the Bush administration that could hinder progress on global climate change policy. The Senate banned new coal mining and oil and gas drilling in national monuments. Other recent rebuffs included rejections of administration initiatives on such issues as the Endangered Species Act hard-rock mining regulations and offshore drilling for oil and gas. Copyright 2001 Los Angeles Times <http://www.latimes.com> Federal Caps Didn't Deter Higher Prices Power: Cal-ISO study says suppliers continued to charge as much as five times more than the imposed limits. By NANCY VOGEL TIMES STAFF WRITER July 27 2001 SACRAMENTO -- After federal regulators limited wholesale electricity prices last month big private sellers of power in California continued to ask as much as five times more for electricity than the federal cap according to a confidential study by state grid operators. The analysis by the California Independent System Operator covers only the first week after the caps were imposed June 20. Cal-ISO has submitted the data to federal regulators for potential investigation. The report is a summary of what Cal-ISO calls possible anti-competitive behavior by Duke Energy Williams Cos. Mirant Corp. Reliant Energy and Dynegy Corp. In a truly competitive market we would expect these suppliers to bid very close to their actual operating cost said Greg Cook senior policy analyst with Cal-ISO's Department of Market Analysis. The state did not necessarily purchase any power at the high prices being demanded. Instead the significance of the bids is that they show how California could find itself paying exorbitant prices for electricity again if hot weather returns and conservation slackens said Frank Wolak a Stanford University economist who studies the California electricity market. The bottom line is that the generators are putting out these bids in expectation of high demand he said. If weather all of a sudden gets really hot from Southern to Northern California the bids submitted by generators could be very costly to California. Cal-ISO calculated the cost of production for each company based on the efficiency of its power plants and estimates of what each paid for natural gas to fuel the plants. The average cost for the five was $105 per megawatt-hour which closely matches the federal price limit in California which now stands at $101 per megawatt-hour. According to the power bidding procedures companies that bid at or below their cost of production often still get paid a higher price allowing them to make a substantial profit. On average four of the five companies submitted bids either slightly below or slightly above their cost of production. But with the exception of Atlanta-based Mirant each company at times submitted bids that were substantially higher. Houston-based Reliant for example bid as much as $540 per megawatt-hour more than five times its estimated cost. Overall Reliant's average bid was close to costs according to the analysis. Cal-ISO identified companies by code in its report. Sources familiar with the study identified the companies for The Times. The Cal-ISO report singled out Supplier 5 identified by sources as Charlotte N.C.-based Duke Energy saying the company continues to bid significantly in excess of its operating costs. Duke owns two large power plants on the central coast. It marked up its bids an average of 88% beyond its cost to produce electricity according to the analysis. For example it cost Duke $85 to $121 to generate a megawatt-hour of electricity in the time period studied the report shows but the company offered to sell a megawatt-hour from $149 to $195. Duke spokesman Tom Williams on Thursday said The use of the data in some cases doesn't appear to add up and in all cases appears to be selective and could easily be misunderstood. Duke sells nearly the entire output of its power plants under long-term contracts and not on the spot market which the Cal-ISO report studied he noted. Reliant spokesman Richard Wheatley said We're looking at the data and we question whether or not it is correct. A combination of cool weather heavy conservation the start-up of new power plants and recently signed long-term power contracts that guarantee supplies have eased the state's electricity crisis in recent weeks. Market prices that as recently as May averaged $271 per megawatt-hour have dropped to less than $100 per megawatt-hour. The more abundant power supplies have freed grid operators to ignore higher-priced bids. But they will have to consider paying such prices to avoid blackouts if supplies tighten Wolak said. Such a scenario would test the effectiveness of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission order issued June 19 he said. The bids of the five companies analyzed were offers of sales to Cal-ISO a Folsom-based agency that manages the electrical transmission grid serving 75% of California. Cal-ISO buys power on short notice to smooth the flow on the state's electrical freeway and avert blackouts. As California's fledgling market began to go haywire last fall Cal-ISO workers struggled to purchase as much as 30% of the state's power demand with just hours to spare. Since then the market has stabilized and Cal-ISO's purchases now amount to roughly 5% of the electricity California consumes. RELATED STORY Power profits: Power plant operator Calpine said its quarterly profit more than doubled. C2 Copyright 2001 Los Angeles Times <http://www.latimes.com> Calpine profits double on skyrocketing sales Escalating power prices inspire plant building program Carolyn Said Chronicle Staff Writer Friday July 27 2001 2001 San Francisco Chronicle </chronicle/info/copyright> URL: BU234287.DTL> Fueled by high electricity prices power generator Calpine Corp. reported strong second-quarter results yesterday. Calpine of San Jose said profit for the quarter ended June 30 almost doubled to $107.7 million (32 cents per share) from $59.5 million (20 cents) during the year-ago quarter. Revenue almost quadrupled to $1.61 billion from $417.2 million a year ago. Excluding charges related to the acquisition of Canada's Encal Energy Calpine's net income was $132.2 million (39 cents) well above the 31 cents per share predicted by analysts according to Thomson Financial/First Call. Calpine is on an ambitious path to expand its roster of generating plants. By the end of 2005 it expects to have 75000 megawatts in operation in the United States including 12000 megawatts in California. A megawatt is about enough power for 1000 homes. The company which generates 2428 megawatts in California this summer opened the state's first two major power plants in a decade. The new plants in Yuba City (Sutter County) and Pittsburg generate 547 and 555 megawatts respectively. Combined with a new plant in Arizona that sells power to California Calpine's new facilities helped the state stave off threatened blackouts this summer Chief Executive Officer Peter Cartwright said. Calpine is building the 847-megawatt Delta Energy Center in Pittsburg scheduled to open in May and a 750-megawatt plant in Kern County due in June 2003. It is also awaiting an August decision by the California Energy Commission on its proposed 600-megawatt Metcalf Energy Center in San Jose. California is a very good market for us said Bill Highlander a Calpine spokesman. The pricing in California has benefited Calpine. However he said the company was not one of the traders that focused on making top dollar in California's volatile spot market because its business model concentrated on selling electricity through long-term contracts. During the past few months Calpine signed 10-year and 20-year contracts with the state for as much as 2500 megawatts at prices ranging from $58.60 to $73 per megawatt hour. With most of its plants fired by natural gas Calpine wants to control about a quarter of the gas it uses Highlander said. Its April purchase of Encal Energy for $1.77 billion more than doubled its gas reserves to about 1. 7 trillion cubic feet equivalent according to Hoover's Online. Calpine's stock closed up $1.08 at $36.89 yesterday.

In one case an energy company charged as much as five times more for electricity than the federal cap which were imposed June 20. State grid operators have given the study to federal regulators for a possible investigation the Los Angeles Times reported Friday. Five companies were identified by code in the report and sources familiar with the study named the wholesalers for the Times. They include Duke Energy Dynegy Corp. Mirant Corp. Reliant Corp. and Williams Cos. The average price charged by the five power companies was $105 per megawatt-hour which closely matches the federal price limit in California set at $101 per megawatt-hour. Four of the five companies submitted bids either just below or just above their cost of production. Houston-based Reliant however asked as much as $540 per megawatt-hour in some cases. Overall the company's average bid was close to costs the report said. The state wasn't required to purchase power at the rates set by wholesalers but the bids reflect a potential repeat of charging exorbitant electricity prices if temperatures soar and conservation dwindles said Frank Wolak a Stanford University economist who studies the California electricity market. The bottom line is that the generators are putting out these bids in expectation of high demand he said. If weather all of a sudden gets really hot from Southern to Northern California the bids submitted by generators could be very costly to California. The Cal-ISO report singled out Duke Energy noting it continues to bid significantly in excess of its operating costs. The report shows the company's cost to produce electricity was between $85 and $121 but it offered to sell a megawatt-hour from $149 to $195. Cal-ISO calculated the cost of production for each company based on the efficiency of its power plants and estimates what each paid for natural gas to fuel the plants.

Saying the permit was illegally awarded the suit warns that the resulting project will damage the ecologically important Elkorn Slough. Voices of the Wetlands accuses the board that awarded the permit of violating federal law by not requiring Duke to use the best possible technology to minimize impacts on the environment around the Moss Landing power plant. If plans to expand the plant proceed without change the group said it would kill off critical organisms at the bottom of the food chain. The suit filed in Monterey County against the California State Water Resources Control Board and the regional board that serves the central coast seeks a court order to return the case to the regional water district so that more environmentally sensitive cooling technology can be ordered for use at the plant. State officials said yesterday that the issues raised in the suit were considered and rejected during the initial permit approval process last year and again during the appeal process this year. The case comes amid enormous pressure on state officials in light of California's energy crisis to rapidly accelerate power plant approvals and expand the amount of power generation available. Against this backdrop the state water board on June 21 essentially rejected environmental groups' appeal that had sought to overturn the district board's decision approving the Moss Landing expansion permit. On another front board members of the California Energy Commission took testimony earlier this week on a proposal to curtail public review of plant project proposals with one board member Robert A. Laurie acknowledging in an interview that he believed in some cases it posed one of the most time- consuming aspects of project approval. A recommendation is expected within the next month. Duke of Charlotte N.C. bought the Moss Landing plant from Pacific Gas & Electric Co. in 1998 when the Northern California utility sold off many of its facilities to prepare for deregulation of the energy market. The plant was built in 1950 using a cooling system technology that sucks water out of the Elkorn Slough and Monterey Bay to cool generating turbines before spitting the water out into the Pacific Ocean. The group says wildlife conditions and sea otter population have improved markedly since PG&E mothballed many of the generating units at Moss Landing in 1995. But Duke now is proposing to resurrect parts of the cooling system in a major expansion that will make Moss Landing the state's largest power plant after its completion next summer. With an output of 2538 megawatts the plant when completed is expected to account for 30 percent of all new electricity generated in California next year serving about 2.5 million households in the Monterey Santa Cruz and southern Santa Clara County areas including San Jose. Regional water quality board officials declined comment yesterday citing the pending litigation. But in public documents filed yesterday water officials said cooling alternatives had been considered and rejected. The documents did not elaborate on why they were not mandated. Duke had acknowledged during the process that more ecologically sensitive technologies were available but at prohibitive costs of $20 million to $50 million more. Deborah Sivas an attorney for the Earthjustice Environmental Law Clinic which filed the suit on behalf of Voices of the Wetlands considered the best technology alternatives mandatory not optional. She said the board had not considered alternative approaches in reaching its conclusions.

Take the Edison bail out as evidence. At its essence the deal works like this: Taxpayers give the utility a big pile of cash the state gets some old rickety transmission lines in return. Don't be fooled: The power bounty is basically a political ploy. The state doesn't need to control electric distribution. What politicos need is a face-saving trade as evidence that this is a business deal - not a government handout. The state probably should just write the check and eat its losses. But if bureaucrats wanted real remuneration from this bail out California would eye some juicy Edison assets. As a public service I'll list a few. Now for argument's sake I won't differentiate between the utility and its parent company Edison International. Hey lawyers built those walls between the two. Let 'em figure out how to take 'em down. For starters you'd figure an energy-strapped state would like some regional power plants no? Like the San Onofre facility. However it might be laughable to see Sacramento-types defending their future handling of the local nuclear plant. OK if that's a tad too dicey for the state how about a coal-fired plant in Nevada? Heck Edison had a buyer at half a billion bucks before the state oddly quashed that deal. Maybe the state could grab it from Edison -- then flip it to pay off electricity-related debts. Of course buying one of the out-of-town power plants that Edison's sister company in Irvine has acquired might be educational for Sacramento. Owning a plant in Illinois or Pennsylvania or possibly New Zealand might show state honchos how easy - or not - it is to rig supply and prices. Alternatively the state could demand a small entity called Edison Capital. Basically it's a bank. One specialty: the politically correct field of affordable-housing lending. A good fit for bureaucrats. Speaking of money there's the Edison pension plan. Governments are really good at running retirement benefits. Heck California already has a huge one. There's got to be some economies of scale - real cash savings - in merging the Edison plan with some state pension fund. Do note that Edison's plan might be overfunded by about $400 million. You can bet though that the state would never have the nerve to play 1980s corporate raider: profiting by grabbing some of a company's overfunded retirement kitty. Finally there's Edison International Field in Anaheim. Stadium naming-rights contracts must have some value since corporations always seem to fight over these promotional gimmicks. (The utility's parent company paid $50 million in 1997 for two decades of free publicity.) Imagine the buzz the state could get out of the huge sign age on a nationally renowned stadium. Plus maybe the Angels could be good corporate citizens and tie into this deal. It's possible they'd allow a slight change in the team name to better emphasize the state's role in the ballpark. So how does California Angels sound to you? Business Financial Desk California Sempra Continues Improved Results NANCY RIVERA BROOKS 07/27/2001 Los Angeles Times Home Edition Page C-2 Copyright 2001 / The Times Mirror Company Sempra Energy on Thursday reported another quarter of higher earnings and revenue a sharp contrast to California 's bigger and beleaguered investor-owned utilities. Although California 's electricity crisis has pushed Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electricity into insolvency--and PG&E into U.S. Bankruptcy Court--the parent of San Diego Gas & Electric and Southern California Gas continues to post improved results on the strength of its non-utility businesses. Net income for the period ended June 30 rose 25% to $137 million or 66 cents a share up $25 million or 55 cents earned a year ago the San Diego-based utility holding company said. Revenue jumped 40% to $2.1 billion. Pretax operating income rose 24% to $291 million. Sempra's earnings came in just ahead of the 65-cent average estimate of analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial. Our strong second-quarter performance is primarily the result of our efforts to accelerate growth through new businesses Stephen L. Baum Sempra's chairman chief executive and president told analysts in a conference call. Sempra is in a vastly different position than Edison International and PG&E Corp. because its electric utility arm was able to avoid the deep financial woes afflicting their respective Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric utilities. SDG&E was first to sell its power plants two years ago and thus was freed from a rate freeze. That in turn allowed the utility to pass along to customers the soaring costs of electricity beginning last summer. The state Legislature eventually rolled back and capped the rates for SDG&E customers but promised the utility it would be allowed to recover those losses. Edison and PG&E however continued to accumulate staggering debts because their retail rate freezes remained in place. In contrast Sempra is solvent with $1.5 billion in cash and $1 billion in available credit Baum said. The performance of its utilities was lackluster with Southern California Gas earning $47 million unchanged from the second quarter of 2000 and SDG&E earning $37 million down from $40 million in the year-ago period. But Sempra's unregulated businesses--including energy trading power plant construction and operation international electricity operations and energy services--turned in an overall strong performance contributing 39% of the parent company's earnings. Sempra's trading unit provided most of that profit contributing $69 million to second-quarter net income compared with $40 million in the same quarter last year. Sempra's stock gained 17 cents to close at $25.49 on the New York Stock Exchange. Business Financial Desk California Calpine Doubles Earnings Beats Forecasts Energy: San Jose-based company credits higher electricity prices in California and sales from new plants. 07/27/2001 Los Angeles Times Home Edition Page C-2 Copyright 2001 / The Times Mirror Company Calpine Corp. one of the biggest U.S. power-plant builders said Thursday that second-quarter earnings more than doubled beating estimates because of higher electricity prices in California and sales from new plants. Profit from operations rose to $132.2 million or 39 cents a share from net income of $59.5 million or 20 cents a year earlier. Revenue almost quadrupled to $1.61 billion. San Jose-based Calpine opened plants in the U.S. with a combined capacity of 1545 megawatts--enough to light 1.5 million average homes--and benefited from existing plants in California . Calpine has insulated itself from rising fuel costs by buying natural-gas fields to supply its plants. Given the strategy they have chosen they're following through quite well said Andre Meade an analyst at Commerzbank Capital Markets Co. They are growing from a small base and adding a lot of plants so we'd expect high growth. Profit topped the 31-cent average estimate of analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial. Calpine said it expects to earn $2 a share this year. The average First Call forecast was $1.92 with a range of $1.80 to $2.04. Calpine's shares rose $1.08 or 3% to close at $36.89 on the New York Stock Exchange. The shares had fallen 21% this year amid concern that generators might have to give back some of the profit they made selling power in California during the last year. In addition cooler-than-normal weather and conservation efforts recently reduced power prices in the state. Calpine runs or is building natural gas plants in 29 U.S. states and Canada that produce more than 30000 megawatts of power. The company plans to more than double capacity to 70000 megawatts by the end of 2005. Calpine this month opened the $350-million Sutter plant California 's first major generator in more than a decade. The company is building 11 plants to run during times of peak demand in the state and getting permits for four more James Macias who oversees Calpine's West Coast power plants said in a conference call with analysts and investors. Separately Arlington Va.-based AES Corp. a power producer that supplies California and operates in 27 countries said second-quarter profit fell 20% because of losses tied to currency fluctuations and the sale of a U.S. electricity retailer. Net income fell to $112 million or 21 cents a share from $140 million or 28 cents a year earlier. Sales rose 26% to $2.21 billion. California  Metro Desk Cap No Bar to Higher Prices Power: Cal-ISO study says suppliers continued to charge as much as five times more than the U.S.-imposed limits. NANCY VOGEL 07/27/2001 Los Angeles Times Ventura County Edition Page B-1 Copyright 2001 / The Times Mirror Company SACRAMENTO -- After federal regulators limited wholesale electricity prices last month big private sellers of power in California continued to ask as much as five times more for electricity than the federal cap according to a confidential study by state grid operators. The analysis by the California Independent System Operator covers only the first week after the caps were imposed June 20. Cal-ISO has submitted the data to federal regulators for potential investigation. The report is a summary of what Cal-ISO calls possible anti-competitive behavior by Duke Energy Williams Cos. Mirant Corp. Reliant Energy and Dynegy Corp. In a truly competitive market we would expect these suppliers to bid very close to their actual operating cost said Greg Cook senior policy analyst with Cal-ISO's Department of Market Analysis. The state did not necessarily purchase any power at the high prices being demanded. Instead the significance of the bids is that they show how California could find itself paying exorbitant prices for electricity again if hot weather returns and conservation slackens said Frank Wolak a Stanford University economist who studies the California electricity market. The bottom line is that the generators are putting out these bids in expectation of high demand he said. If weather all of a sudden gets really hot from Southern to Northern California  the bids submitted by generators could be very costly to California . Cal-ISO calculated the cost of production for each company based on the efficiency of its power plants and estimates of what each paid for natural gas to fuel the plants. The average cost for the five was $105 per megawatt-hour which closely matches the federal price limit in California  which now stands at $101 per megawatt-hour. According to the power bidding procedures companies that bid at or below their cost of production often still get paid a higher price allowing them to make a substantial profit. On average four of the five companies submitted bids either slightly below or slightly above their cost of production. But with the exception of Atlanta-based Mirant each company at times submitted bids that were substantially higher. Houston-based Reliant for example bid as much as $540 per megawatt-hour more than five times its estimated cost. Overall Reliant's average bid was close to costs according to the analysis. Cal-ISO identified companies by code in its report. Sources familiar with the study identified the companies for The Times. The Cal-ISO report singled out Supplier 5 identified by sources as Charlotte N.C.-based Duke Energy saying the company continues to bid significantly in excess of its operating costs. Duke owns two large power plants on the central coast. It marked up its bids an average of 88% beyond its cost to produce electricity  according to the analysis. For example it cost Duke $85 to $121 to generate a megawatt-hour of electricity in the time period studied the report shows but the company's bids ranged from $149 to $195 per megawatt-hour. Duke spokesman Tom Williams on Thursday said The use of the data in some cases doesn't appear to add up and in all cases appears to be selective and could easily be misunderstood. Duke sells nearly the entire output of its power plants under long-term contracts and not on the spot market which the Cal-ISO report studied he noted. Calpine Net Soars On Added Plants Sempra Profit Rises By Rebecca Smith 07/27/2001 The Wall Street Journal Page B4 (Copyright (c) 2001 Dow Jones & Company Inc.) Calpine Corp. reported net income nearly doubled in the second quarter reflecting the independent power producer's aggressive plant-building program. Meanwhile the parent of a San Diego utility said profit rose 25%. Calpine of San Jose Calif. said net was $107.7 million or 32 cents a share up from $59.5 million or 20 cents a share a year earlier. The latest results which were in line with analysts' expectations included a special charge of seven cents a share related to Calpine's purchase of Encal Energy Ltd. a natural-gas company. Revenue grew even more strongly soaring to $1.61 billion from $417.2 million. Separately Sempra Energy parent of electric utility San Diego Gas & Electric reported profit rose to $137 million from $110 million a year earlier. Revenue jumped 40% to $2.1 billion from $1.5 billion. Sempra Chairman Steve Baum attributed the growth which stands in marked contrast to the financial woes of California 's other electric-utility-owning energy companies to Sempra's unregulated operations. Calpine's profit increased despite paying substantially more for natural gas to fuel its plants. It spent an average of $4.80 per million British Thermal Units for natural gas up from $3.31 a year before. At the same time Calpine's revenue per megawatt hour of electricity sold also rose to $71.03 in the latest period from $64.80 a year earlier. At Sempra Mr. Baum said profit from Sempra's biggest utility unit San Diego Gas & Electric fell 7.5% to $37 million from $40 million. Results were flat at its gas-distribution company Southern California Gas Co. Sempra Energy Trading was the big profit center generating half its total profit or $69 million compared with $40 million a year earlier. Mr. Baum said Sempra's stock which trades at a low price/earnings multiple of 10 still is being affected negatively by the California situation. He also said the company made less money in spot-power markets than in prior quarters but nevertheless intends to invest $2 billion in new power plants. In 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composite trading Calpine shares rose $1.08 to $36.89 while Sempra climbed 17 cents to $25.49.,"Energy; California; Power; Electricity; Prices; Regulation

Similar letters were delivered by Greenpeace Europe in native languages to Enron's offices in the UK Netherlands Spain and Belgium. I have attached a copy of one of the letters below. All the questions are the same in each. I have drafted a response with the goals of: 1) Being responsive to Greenpeace without being defensive or without greenwashing. We have an already-published public statement on climate change and a very positive solution-oriented story to tell with many facts and accomplishments to back up our statements. I think our letter can land in the stack that they consider positive responses and not in the stack of non-responses or we don't care responses. 2) Steering away from directly answering the no-win questions about Kyoto. I think we can respond to the letter in a way that provides meaningful answers to the general themes of the letter. I have discussed this with many of you already but I strongly feel that we should not get dragged down into debates over what we like/dislike support/oppose about Kyoto....we'll quickly get into questions we can't now answer and may never be able to answer. I'd prefer it if we rise above the politics of the issue and look solution-oriented by saying counties and companies should continue to be engaged in this important issue. 3) Developing corporate-wide messages that we can use in multiple applications -- arming our PR and govt. affairs advocates with a tight script to use in their efforts responding to shareholder inquiries and annual meeting Q&A Ken Lay or other executive speeches and presentations something for our Corporate Responsibility annual report. Sorry for the long preamble but climate change has become a very sensitive issue of late and our message/strategy needs to be very coordinated and we need to have one clear set of statements that everyone in the company can understand and use. With that said I also believe that these messages should be used very carefully as the subject matter is complex and straying too far from the basics can be dangerous. We should designate one or two clear spokespeople that can answer any follow up to the Greenpeace letter by press or policymakers and really stick to the boundaries of what's in our response letter. There is also the issue of customizing responses from the European offices using this letter as a template and adding a few examples of Enron good deeds in the local areas. I am not opposed to doing so but would again appreciate being able to review these responses before they go. Please let me know if you have other views. I would like to send our response by early next week maybe even Monday 4/23 if we can turn it around that fast. Thank you for your input and assistance and I look forward to your reply.

They are getting pulled in bo= th directions they say and are inclined to drop the 40000 MW number -- p= ossibly leaving it to FERC to set a number. They conceded that the mechani= cs of the draft make it unlikely that the 18 month deadline for all trans= mission owners to get into an approved RTO would stick. They consciously c= hanged the normal judicial standard of review for FERC actions from arbitr= ary and capricious to preponderance of the evidence because they think o= therwise the courts will rubber stamp FERC.

He made a big deal out of a Big Mac analogy -- saying that whether you ordered one in Portland Oregon or Portland Maine the product is the same. With RTOs he supposedly said this meant if the rules are standardized the number of RTOs becomes less important. Those in the room including EPSA staff came away with the impression that Wood is backing away from only 4 RTOs based on this and other comments. Ditto on a 12/15/01 deadline. On the positive side he did say that he had been consulted on the Administration's comments on the Bingaman bill and agreed that legislation without RTO language or bundled/unbundled is OK. He understands the high risk that Congress would go the wrong way on these issues. ,"RTOs; NERC; Government; Regulation

1204,Re: Daily Update/ Legislative activity - 08/24/00,I attended Cmmr. Wood's two-day hearing on Wholesale Markets which concluded today (8/24) in San Diego. Three Commissioner's were present (Wood Lynch and Neeper) with Duque and Bilas participating by phone. Administrative Law Judge Wetzel was present and a transcript was taken. The quasi-legislative hearing was the beginning of a record developed for the investigation into the workings of wholesale/retail markets. This session focused on Wholesale markets. There will be subsequent sessions on retail issues market structure and other related issues in the future. My conclusion from this session is that Wood is looking for support for increasing regulatory intervention in the market. Dan Larcamp Director of the Office of markets Tariffs and Rates FERC was present. He relayed FERC's concern of this matter and a desire to hold hearings in San Diego. He also relayed that Hoecker held a press conference announcing the opening of a 206 investigative proceeding into the operation of the wholesale markets in California which carried with it refund authority. The format of the hearing was to respond to pre-filed questions developed by Wood/Lynch. Each member of the panel would respond to the questions and any questions posed by the Commissioners the Judge or the CPUC Attorney. No questions were posed by members of the audience. Yesterday's panel of academics were comprised of: 1. Dr. Timothy Duane-UC Berkley 2. Dr. William Hogan-Harvard 3. Dr. Frank Wolak-Stanford (ISO Market Surveillance Committee) 4. David Marcus-Energy Consultant for the Coaltion of Utility Employees 5. Dr. Gene Coyle 6. Dr. Jean-Michel Glachant Universite Paris I Pantheon Sorbonne The panel was asked to speak as individuals and not on behalf of any institutions they may represent. While the purpose of the panel seemed to be to determine that market power was being exercised and that prices were too high and therefore not just and reasonable the panelist stopped short of blaming generators and market participants in behaving illegally. The concensus generally was that market power did exist at various times but the mere existence did not constitute bad behavior. None with the exception of Dr. Wolak who is in the process of doing a study using recent data as part of his role for the Market Surveillance Committee had done a study. There was some discussion though not much of the monopsony power of the utilities. I think ultimately the group conceded that scarcity of supply amplified concerns about the exercise of market power as even the increase in gas costs did not fully explain the recent spikes. Wolak believes that encourage utilities to enter into forward purchases will reduce the exercise of real-time market power. Hogan seemed to be there with Sempra's interests in mind. He continued to promote expansion of the ISO's abilities to dispatch load as well as maintain system reliability. There was alot of discussion about forward purchase ability for utilities so as to be less subject to volatile market prices. The concerns were also discussed about the appropriateness of a distribution utility making purchasing decisions on behalf of its customers. This included discussion of separation of these functions and the default provider role. Most everyone agreed that rolling back to a regulated market was not feasible without raising other major and serious concerns however there seemed to be support for some interim measures where cost-of-service regulation may be a good idea and that was during peak periods. All agreed that a demand response and price signals are important in the long-run although not to the extent currently experienced in San Diego. Today's panel included representatives from SDG&E SCE and PG&E TURN UCAN and ORA. While yesterday's panel maintained objectivity as to whether or not generators were exercising market power to the detriment of the system today's panel made no bones about the generators being to blame. SCE/PG&E indicated their need for relief for recovery of market costs in excess of the rate freeze. SDG&E was still on the hot seat for their inaction in hedging any of their supply. SDG&E brought up their failed PBR proposal and ORA and UCAN thought that that may be one way to incent the utility to be more responsible with their purchases. UCAN discussed the Governor's direction and the potential for putting rate caps into affect for residential and small commercial. He mentioned that C&I customers are experience difficulties as well. TURN raised the need for cost-based bid caps and cost-based peaking contracts. Mike Florio TURN urged against any further divestitute of assets and alleged market concentration on those assets that had been divested. In fact TURN urged the Commission to seek legislation to clarify the Commission's authority to order retention of assets. Neeper urged that part of the solution should be changing the current requirement to use the PX as the only authorized exchange although TURN disagreed.

Good new - The Williamson Act passed the Senate 34-1 It should be heard at the assembly Saturday or Monday if it is not redirected to a Committee hearing. 2. There was a long meeting with Ducheny with regards to AB 970. The enviro's boycotted they want to draft a bill with Keeley. Labor was obstructionist - they wanted to gut all the expediting siting language with regards to all facilities except for the peaking plants. Rate Cap related bills 1. The Edison Language on Rate Stabilization may not go anywhere. Edison has not found an author because of the efforts of Enron and others lobbying against it. Furthermore there are signs that Gov. Davis opposes it. 2. The Governor's office has issued a proposed language for a rate cap bill. The language however is not available as of yet. It may be released today or tomorrow. SDG&E has shown concerns over the content of the bill. They seem to think that it is worse than initially proposed by the Governor in his press release. The bill includes retroactive rate caps through 6/1/00. The rate cap could reflect Wood's rate cap proposal (6.5 cts cap on the energy component The bill does not specify who or how the costs associated with the cap will be recovered. (The reasoning is that UDCs will be more cautious in their procurement if there is uncertainty on who is responsible for the costs.) All of this is speculative. We hope to see the actual language soon. 3. Enron has been working with the Republican leadership to promote a rate cap proposal similar to the amended language we have proposed for AB2290. The bill focuses only on SDG&E customers and our major principals are the following. The Interim Rate Cap should be limited to residential and small commercial customers plus specific institutions that have a significant public role such as schools and hospitals. The Interim Rate Cap should be limited to the period ending December 31 2001. The Interim Rate Cap must be structured so that any undercollection is eventually recovered from the same customers who benefit from the lower rates provided by the rate cap.,"Energy; Regulation; California; FERC; Hearings

1213,Talking Points For Rep. Barton On Tauzin RTO Letter,Linda requested some background and talking points on the pending RTO letter from Chairman Tauzin to FERC that is sitting on Chairman Barton's desk TODAY for his decision whether to co-sign the letter. While we have not seen the text we are told that it is anti-RTO and may go so far as to state or imply that FERC does not have authority to do what is doing with RTOs. (We know this is the view of one of Chairman Tauzin's counsels who formerly worked for Southern Co.). Chairman Tauzin has been contacted by Entergy and the Louisiana Public Service Commission to send the letter. I spoke to Chairman Barton's staff Andy Black this afternoon and relayed our concerns. The Barton Subcommittee is now expected to mark up an electricity bill in December (per a Republican Member meeting held this morning). ACTION ITEM: Call Rep. Joe Barton (202/225-2002) TALKING POINTS: 1. Should start with something about the Dynegy/Enron transaction (it will be strange if Mr. Lay or Steve calls Chairman Barton and does not start the conversation with some reference to the transaction). 2. Mentioning the transaction naturally leads into the importance of competitive wholesale markets for power both for consumers and for the largely Texas-based marketing trading and merchant power industries. 3. We understand that Chairman Barton has been approached by Chairman Tauzin about a letter to FERC on the RTO issue. We know Chairman Barton is well aware of Enron's strong support for FERC's RTO initiatives. We respect Chairman Barton's interest in seeing to it that Congress does not abdicate its responsibility to make energy policy. 4. If as we have been lead to believe the letter states or implies that FERC does not have authority to act in the RTO arena this will be seen as a potentially destabilizing development since FERC is so far down the road of creating RTOs. 5. While we understand some in Congress and elsewhere were concerned that FERC was moving too fast as of the last FERC meeting earlier this month that is no longer true even if it ever was true. While we think RTOs should be created sooner rather than later FERC is listening to state regulators and others who had concerns. 6. A letter from congressional leaders questioning FERC's authority goes too far in the direction of those who oppose any RTOs. Furthermore it is wrong as a matter of law. The D.C. Circuit held in the gas cases and in the power cases on Order 888 that FERC has authority to address systemic discrimination which is in large part what the RTOs are all about -- a remedy for iscrimination.,"Energy; FERC; RTOs; Congress; Regulation

Davis's Plan To Power California --- State's Outlays for Electricity May Be Hard to Recover Without Rate Increases --- Betting on Long-Term Deals ------------------------ Breakthrough made in rescue of PG&E State ready to pay $7 billion for lines By Steve Geissinger SACRAMENTO BUREAU SACRAMENTO -- Signaling a breakthrough in secret energy crisis talks the Davis administration disclosed Tuesday it may announce the framework of a pact to rescue the teetering Pacific Gas and Electric Co. next week. Things are going very well said Steve Maviglio a spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis. The state appears to be poised to pay at least $7 billion -- and possibly billions more -- for PG&E's high-voltage transmission lines as part of a deal to financially renovate the north-state utility according to sources familiar with the negotiations. But consumer advocates insisted that even the $7 billion price is too much to pay. And experts warned that a deal with PG&E will be more complex than with other utilities. PG&E representatives declined comment in keeping with their policy on the talks even though the Davis administration said an announcement could come as early as next week or the following week. The new timetable for an announcement was substantially sooner than in Davis' original forecast. Until late last week PG&E was still resisting the sale of its power grid despite the fact that Davis had announced the framework of an agreement with Southern California Edison. Davis expects to soon announce a similar deal with the San Diego Gas and Electric Co. However any such deal still would need federal approval. The investor-owned utilities trapped between high wholesale costs and lower regulated retail rates amassed nearly $13 billion in debts and were unable to buy electricity this winter. With the onset of rolling blackouts the state began brokering billions of dollars in emergency short- and long-term power purchases. Davis' strategy to ease the energy price and supply crisis includes bolstering both conservation and generation while fiscally refurbishing the nearly bankrupt utilities. As part of the rescue deal the utilities would have to drop legal actions seeking dramatically higher electricity bills environmentally shield wildlands they own sell power from their generators to Californians for the next decade and secure help with their debts from their parent companies. Together with the cash infusion from the sale of their power 26000-mile power grids the utilities would be allowed to sell bonds to raise funds and use customer money to pay them off. The state would upgrade the high-voltage lines and lease them back to the utilities for operation. In a reflection of the negotiations with the three utilities a Davis administration official said the deal with PG&E is proving to be more complex than with the other firms. Though PG&E finally agreed late last week to sell its transmission grid the utility apparently wants more than the $7 billion that Davis has offered according to sources. The figure is more than twice the book amount or the value placed on the system for purposes of accounting. And that's the markup that lured Edison into an agreement to sell its smaller portion of the transmission grid for $2.8 billion. But PG&E which fears an erosion of its economic base may be asking as much as $10 billion. Due to complexities in the state's 1996 deregulation of the industry PG&E is more likely to lose revenue than Edison as a result of selling its transmission lines according to experts. Big customers might be able to bypass the utility's remaining local distribution lines thereby eroding its customer base. Therefore the utility may view bankruptcy and sale of its transmission lines to the highest bidder as a potentially attractive alternative to selling its share of the grid to the state at too low a price. ---- El Paso Energy closes six valley power plants Filed: 03/07/2001 By CHIP POWER Californian staff writer e-mail: ppower@bakersfield.com El Paso Energy citing non-payment from Pacific Gas & Electric Co. said it has shut down six cogeneration plants this week. The smaller plants produced about 175 megawatts of electricity and are located primarily in the San Joaquin Valley said company spokesman Mel Scott. A megawatt can supply power to 1000 homes. At least 10 plants have closed in the past two weeks as a result of non-payment according to the state Independent System Operator which manages most of the state's electrical distribution. The El Paso Energy plants are operated with various partners and had not been compensated for December January and February deliveries said Scott. He said he did not know the total amount due but said the plants would be closed until PG&E's credit worthiness is improved. A cogeneration plant common in oil fields simultaneously produces heat energy and electrical or mechanical power from the same fuel in the same facility. Typically it produces electricity and steam which can be deployed to enhance oil recovery. Kern County is the state's leading oil-producing county. El Paso owns or has interests in more than 40000 miles of interstate and intrastate pipeline connecting the nation's principal natural gas supply regions to the five largest consuming regions in the United States namely the Gulf Coast California the Northeast the Midwest and the Southeast. El Paso closed up 99 cents on Tuesday or 1.4 percent at $71.49. The Houston-based company's stock price has ranged between $36.31 and $75.30 in the last 52 weeks. ---- Still undecided: Who'll pay DWR for electricity By Karen Gaudette ASSOCIATED PRESS SAN FRANCISCO -- The price tag is $3.2 billion and counting for electricity bought by the state Department of Water Resources for the customers of two nearly bankrupt utilities. Pacific Gas and Electric Co. Southern California Edison and the state disagree over how the DWR eventually will be reimbursed for its purchases on the expensive last-minute power market. So do the state power regulators who have the final call over who gets the money when. Under a recent law the DWR went into the electricity-buying business to help keep the two utilities from sinking further into their $13 billion debt. The state plans to retrieve the money by selling $10 billion in revenue bonds. The utilities continue to collect ratepayer dollars on that electricity which the bill's author Assemblyman Fred Keeley D-Boulder Creek says is meant to help them begin paying down their debt. In a recent letter however DWR officials requested that the state Public Utilities Commission order that a portion of that money be diverted to the state. But after the utilities subtract the costs of generating electricity payments to environmentally friendly power plants and other expenses there is no money left from ratepayer dollars to give to the DWR without sinking further into debt PG&E spokesman Ron Low said Tuesday. If it passed along money to the DWR our undercollection would grow by about $2.4 billion by the end of the year Low said. The commission unable to agree on the best course of action left the issue untouched at its last meeting but expects to revisit the issue when it meets this morning. Commissioner Richard Bilas is proposing an alternate plan that would have the DWR set its own revenue requirements that would be passed on to ratepayers. The PUC also is expected to respond to complaints from laid-off workers and customers that layoffs by utilities to cut costs have been hurting service. Commissioner Carl Wood warned at the last meeting that failure to provide safe and reliable service could mean fines for the utilities. Representatives from electrical workers unions the PUC and the utilities were to discuss the issue Tuesday afternoon. I don't think we believe that utilities can find a way out of their problems by laying off workers said Mindy Spatt a spokeswoman with the Utility Reform Network. We think consumers deserve safe and reliable service and we think they deserve it at a reasonable price. ---- State Taxpayers In Dark on Details Of Energy Deal David Lazarus Chronicle Staff Writer Wednesday March 7 2001 2001 San Francisco Chronicle Few people would purchase a car simply because the dealer said ''Trust me it's a great deal.'' Yet Gov. Gray Davis essentially is telling Californians just that about dozens of long-term power contracts. Because of confidentiality agreements with power companies the governor has revealed only scant details about the state's multibillion-dollar contracts for electricity over the next 10 years. Gov. Davis has our money and we can't see how he's spending it said Doug Heller a spokesman for the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in Santa Monica. We've been locked out of the room. Neither Davis nor power companies would divulge specific details about the price duration or scope of individual contracts. Each cited secrecy clauses that the governor's office said had been desired by both sides. What consumers do know is this: -- California has signed 40 contracts and tentative accords valued at about $40 billion to secure enough power to light 9 million homes over the next decade. -- The average purchase price of each deal is $69 per megawatt hour -- well above the $30 to $40 charged by power generators before California's energy market went haywire last summer. -- If as is widely expected wholesale power prices fall in years ahead the state nevertheless will be locked into paying above-market rates for electricity. But it is not known which generator agreed to part with the most power at the cheapest level or the full range of the prices in concocting the $69 average. Moreover it is unclear how shrewdly the state negotiated with taxpayer money in securing power on behalf of cash-strapped utilities. These agreements are the bedrock of our long-term energy policy Davis said Monday in announcing the deals. The governor's office defended the murky nature of the contracts yesterday. It's a business transaction in which private corporate information is included said Steve Maviglio a spokesman for Davis. That's the kind of information that never gets revealed. While additional elements of the contracts will be publicized in coming months he said the contracts themselves will remain a secret. You'll never see all the details Maviglio said. This did not sit well with many observers. It's a breach of public trust said Daniel Bacon a San Francisco attorney specializing in business law. A public servant spending public money shouldn't be able to keep the spending secret. But Gary Ackerman executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum an energy-industry association in Menlo Park called confidentiality agreements a necessary evil in transactions like this. He explained that no power company would agree to a long-term contract if rival firms could learn the terms of the accord. The company would be losing too much of its competitive edge in the marketplace Ackerman said. At the same time he noted that secrecy allowed the buyer -- in this case California taxpayers -- to secure more favorable terms with individual sellers. A high price with one generator would not necessarily be sought by all power providers. Still the fact that public funds are being used makes confidentiality in this case a different matter than say Cisco Systems' quietly negotiating to take over yet another tech rival. The public is in a very awkward position said Michael Shames executive director of the Utility Consumers' Action Network in San Diego. It has to rely on the good word and expertise of the governor and he has yet to demonstrate that he has expertise or good word in this field. Shames likened consumers to passengers in a plane being flown by a pilot without a license to fly. But what choice do we have? he asked. I don't see many other options available right now. There's the rub. No matter how bad a deal California may have cut to help meet its energy demands the alternative -- blackouts disruptions economic catastrophe -- is far far worse. On the other hand it already appears that the new contracts will not shield Californians from the threat of daily outages this summer when demand surges. Davis said only about 60 percent of the state's summertime electricity needs so far had been met. Part of the reason is that many power companies already have contracted for their output this year. Duke Energy said this was why it would not begin its nine-year contract with California until 2002 while Williams Cos. said it would only gradually increase the amount of available wattage in its 10-year contract. Both companies meanwhile will continue to profit this summer by selling into the volatile spot market where wholesale power went for as much as $1 500 per megawatt hour last year. You can't sell all your power into long-term contracts said Paula Hall- Collins a Williams spokeswoman. You save some for the spot market. Consumer groups worry that consumers will be hammered again this summer with sky-high power prices and then get nailed down the road by contracts for above-market rates. If we could look at the terms of the deals we'd see that California is being gouged for 10 years said Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights. But the governor doesn't want us to see that. Ackerman of the Western Power Trading Forum said the state had gotten the best rates it could under current market conditions. California went for long-term contracts when everyone else moved in as well he said. Californians are paying a price for not acting sooner. ---- Lawmakers pitch fixes for region's energy woes By David Whitney Bee Washington Bureau (Published March 7 2001) WASHINGTON -- California members of Congress pleaded for everything from wholesale price caps to extending daylight-saving time an extra hour to help the region cope this summer with its persistent electricity shortage but none of the ideas seemed to catch fire at a House hearing Tuesday. People will die in California because of this crisis Rep. Brad Sherman a Los Angeles-area Republican warned the House Energy and Commerce Committee. Sherman testified that his idea for saving lives is to extend daylight-saving time by an extra hour so that there would be more daylight at the end of the day when power consumption surges. One of the peak demand periods for electricity occurs between 5 p.m. and 8 p.m. when the sun sets and people come home from work Sherman testified. If people come home and it is light out there is less of an inclination to turn a light on. Sherman said the state Legislature has called for congressional approval for states to be given authority to extend daylight-saving time and he cited analyses by the California Energy Commission and other agencies suggesting that it could cut power consumption by 1 percent to 2 percent. Sherman who was one of about a dozen California lawmakers presenting their views on the energy squeeze drew no questions from committee leaders about what his legislation might do to everything from airline schedules to television programming if West Coast states didn't agree on the same time standard. Most of the committee's questioning was on the more popular idea proposed by several California and Western lawmakers primarily Democrats to require the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to impose caps on wholesale electricity prices that have gone wild because of a regional power shortage. Rep. Bob Filner D-San Diego charged that the price spiral has little to do with power shortages but a lot to do with a small cartel of generators bilking ratepayers. Rep. Jay Inslee D-Wash. said he brought up the idea of regional price caps with President Bush who was initially skeptical. But Inslee said that Bush warmed to the idea after being told that protections could be built into the caps so as not to discourage construction of new power plants. Upon hearing that Inslee said Bush invited him to meet with the president's Cabinet-level task force led by Vice President Dick Cheney on a national energy strategy. But Inslee said he can't get the group to meet with him. It's very disappointing Inslee said. Tuesday's hearing was part of a series the panel is holding on the California crisis so far without any emerging consensus on what if anything Congress should do. ---- Power plan called wrong Wall Street analysts say the governor's approach to the problem avoids the issue that caused the imbalance. March 7 2001 By DON THOMPSON The Associated Press SACRAMENTO California's scramble to insulate consumers from the soaring price of electricity may add to the state's power problems this summer Wall Street analysts said Tuesday. Gov. Gray Davis' emphasis on buying utilities' transmission lines and negotiating long-term power contracts to help ease their debts skirts the deep imbalance between wholesale and market rates that led to the state's power problems in the first place they said. In the long run it doesn't solve anything said Michael Worms an industry analyst for Gerard Klauer Mattison & Co. In the long run you need to send the right price signals to consumers which will create its own conservation signals. Unfortunately customers were shielded from that in California. Davis said Monday that the state's first contracts to buy electricity for two financially struggling utilities will provide only about two-thirds of the power needed on a typical summer day forcing Californians to cut power use at least 10 percent to avoid blackouts. Since early January the state has been buying one- third of the power Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric Co. customers need. The two utilities denied credit by suppliers say they have lost nearly $14 billion due to soaring wholesale electricity prices that the state's industry-deregulation law says they cannot pass on to consumers. The keepers of the state power grid had enough electricity Tuesday to avoid declaring an electricity alert but have faced an almost-daily scramble for weeks due to a tight supply and high wholesale prices. Several wholesale and retail rate proposals are circulating. Among them: Free-market advocates such as Worms want an immediate end to the deregulation-imposed retail rate freeze on Edison and PG&E that will expire next year. Davis wants a Western price cap of $100 per megawatt hour on power generators he says have been prof iteering from California's short energy supply. The Bush administration and Federal Energy Regulatory Commission are cool to that idea. In December FERC imposed a soft cap of $150 per megawatt hour on wholesale rates in the state and required suppliers to justify any higher prices they charge. Consumer groups such as The Utility Reform Network or TURN want regulated rates for residential and small-business customers but free-market rates for large industrial customers which sought deregulation in the first place. TURN also advocates a tiered rate structure with higher rates for consumers who use more than a reasonable amount of electricity each month. Assembly Republicans say electricity and natural-gas prices will fall naturally if the state increases supply mainly by making it easier to build plants and pipelines. Right now you're sort of sitting partially with regulation and part with the free market said Paul Fremont an analyst with Jefferies & Co. Both these systems work. It's sort of that in-between system that you have in Califor nia that doesn't appear to be working. The system discourages generators from building new power plants because they aren't guaranteed a profit and it doesn't do enough to discourage power use by consumers because the price they pay doesn't reflect the true cost of power Fremont said. I don't think people here have much faith in the market and why should they? countered TURN's Mindy Spatt. I think there are probably better ways of encouraging consumers to conserve than by gouging them. Davis insists the crisis can be resolved without raising rates for Edison and PG&E customers beyond the existing rate structure. In January state regulators imposed temporary rate hikes of 7 to 15 percent on Edison and PG&E customers. The Legislature and Davis extended the increases for up to a decade to help pay back the estimated $10 billion in power buying the state expects to do for Edison and PG&E over the next several years and finance its purchase of the power lines owned by the two companies and San Diego Gas & Electric. Rates were already scheduled to increase next year for Edison and PG&E customers. Under the 1996 deregulation law the pair's ratepayers saw a 10 percent rate reduction but only until early 2002. That rate cut will likely expire as planned Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio has said. Davis wants those rates to cover not only the traditional cost of generating transporting and distributing power but the added cost of paying off the two utilities' massive debt and buying their transmission lines said Assemblyman Fred Keeley D-Boulder Creek the Assembly's chief power negotiator. Yet Davis has indirectly addressed the rate imbalance by signing legislation that will let regulators raise consumer rates if necessary Keeley said. The governor and lawmakers are in effect spreading out rate increases over a decade by using long-term revenue bonds to buy power for the nearly bankrupt utilities said Severin Borenstein director of the University of California Energy Institute. At some point we have to deal with the reality that all of the power that we buy has to be paid for by somebody - it's either going to come from taxpayers or it's going to come from ratepayers Bor enstein said. Raising rates now would get us a lot of conservation. Davis also wants financial incentives for conservation and power-plant construction in time to make a difference this summer. Our mouths were agape at the rapid timetable Keeley said. Legislators are rushing to pass those incentives by month's end he said allowing three months for consumers and suppliers to act before the heat of summer. Among bills considered Tuesday the Senate Energy Committee approved legislation to accelerate the siting of power plants. It also was considering a proposal to restructure rates for generators that use renewable energy to provide about 30 percent of the state's electricity. ---- Bill to Cut Some Power Prices Stalls Energy: Democrats balk at varying payment levels for alternative generators. By DAN MORAIN JULIE TAMAKI Times Staff Writers SACRAMENTO--Legislation aimed at cutting prices for more than a fourth of the power consumed in California stalled Tuesday as Democrats questioned why a few alternative energy generators--some of them campaign donors--stood to receive higher payments than others. Lawmakers working to unravel California's energy mess have been negotiating for weeks in an effort to cut the price paid to more than 600 generators of alternative power by more than half to below 8 cents a kilowatt-hour. Those alternative generators' contracts with utilities have shot up in recent months because of a rise in the price of natural gas. The cash-strapped corporations have suspended or made partial payments to the generators over the last few months causing many to shut down or reduce their outputs. But even as the lawmakers reached agreement that pushed the average price to near the 8-cent level per kilowatt-hour some generators would have received higher prices under the bill by state Sen. Jim Battin (R-La Quinta). Some of the generators that stood to benefit had donated to Battin's campaigns. One--Windtec Inc.--gave Battin a $20000 campaign donation in 1999. Others contributed from $3000 and $5000 last year. Battin acknowledged that he has received campaign contributions from some wind power generators but said there is no connection between the donations and the bill's provisions. It is illegal it is unethical and it's not how I do business he said. Battin noted that 25% of the state's alternative energy producers are in his district. As Democrats on the Senate Energy Committee blocked the bill Battin warned that some alternative energy producers might react to the delay by trying to force Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric into bankruptcy. We will be the cause of bankruptcy Battin said. That prompted Energy Committee Chairwoman Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey) to retort: I'm really tired of being threatened with bankruptcy. Alternative energy producers including those that use wind solar power biomass and other means produce 27% of the energy used in California. They sell the electricity to the utilities which in turn transmit it to retail consumers. But with the utilities facing multibillion-dollar debts the alternative energy producers under contract with Edison have not been paid since November. Scores of alternative energy producers supported the measure. Edison International and the San Francisco-based consumer group the Utility Reform Network opposed it. Michael Florio of the Utility Reform group said the deal could result in higher consumer prices an Edison representative said the same thing. Battin and Assemblyman Fred Keeley (D-Boulder Creek) worked out an arrangement with many of the generators. Keeley took the lead in the early negotiations and then turned to Battin to introduce the legislation SB 47X. Rather convoluted language would have allowed higher payments to a select few generators that produce electricity from wind and biomass. Most of California's wind suppliers for instance would have received about 6 cents per kilowatt-hour. But a handful of them about half a dozen wind farms--mostly in the Palm Springs area represented by Battin--would have received 7.8 cents. Battin contends that other wind producers receive additional payments that boost them to the same level as Windtec and others that would get the higher payments. They get the same deal Battin said of the handful of generators that would benefit from the provisions he added to the bill. In California's overall energy market the amount of money that would have flowed to the favored generators is minor. But the added prices that would have been paid to the generators would have translated to at least $19 million in the next five years to be absorbed by Southern California Edison customers according to one analysis. Also Tuesday more details were disclosed about another leg of the state's effort to escape from the energy crunch--the deals with large power generators to supply electricity to California for as long as 10 years. Those arrangements were announced by Gov. Gray Davis Monday as the bedrock of California's energy policy. But some consumer advocates warned that the deals could lock the state into excessively high-priced contracts. S. David Freeman the general manager of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and Davis' negotiator said that the state guarded against that by varying the time spans of its deals. About 6000 megawatts are expected to be available this summer about one-third of the energy needed by the state Freeman said. The amount of power under contract swells until more than 9000 megawatts are contracted in 2004 half of the needed amount before dipping to 8000 megawatts in 2010. What we're doing here is what everybody said had to be done Freeman said. We deliberately bought 50% so we'd have a good mix between long-term contracts which may turn out to be somewhat higher or somewhat lower than the spot market and purchases on the spot market. ---- PG&E could face mutiny on outages: SMUD others may balk if utility orders summer blackouts By Carrie Peyton Bee Staff Writer (Published March 7 2001) Sacramento's electric utility wants out of a deal that imposes rolling blackouts locally on PG&E's command. So do a lot of other utilities. They've been writing letters lobbying lawmakers and launching informal talks with Pacific Gas and Electric Co. to get off the hook before summer. Who dodges the blackout bullet is going to play out as a political hot button around the state said George Fraser head of the Northern California Power Agency a coalition of municipal utilities. In Sacramento the next volley is expected soon with the Sacramento Municipal Utility District reportedly poised to notify PG&E that it will no longer black out homes and businesses on the larger utility's command. We are absolutely trying to fight off the requirement for rolling blackouts for the Sacramento area said Linda Davis one of seven elected members of the SMUD board of directors. Saying they don't want to be dragged down by somebody else's problems two Southern California utilities have written grid operators asking to be exempted from any blackouts caused by PG&E's or Southern California Edison's financial woes. But in PG&E's view California is in an energy crisis (and) ... we're all in this together said spokesman John Nelson. The maneuvering comes amid bleak forecasts for power supplies this summer. Although Gov. Gray Davis has said conservation new power plants and moderate weather could avert blackouts officials at the Independent System Operator which runs much of California's grid expect frequent rotating outages. One consulting firm Cambridge Energy Research Associates predicts 20 hours of rolling blackouts during July and August and about 200 hours of especially intense calls for voluntary cutbacks. Before blackouts hit the jockeying over just whose lights air conditioners and assembly lines will be shut down is growing. The outcome could affect millions of people statewide. The state Public Utilities Commission is probing rolling blackout programs run by the for-profit utilities it regulates including PG&E and Edison. A PUC analysis has suggested that PG&E's program which currently exempts about 40 percent of its customers should spread the burden more broadly. For example it said 1.9 million homes and businesses are spared just because they share a circuit with a customer deemed essential. But not-for-profit utilities such as SMUD which answer to their own elected boards or city councils have other worries. Many have already lined up their power supplies for summer. Some have raised rates or are considering raising rates. Some have taken extra conservation steps. They think those preparations ought to give them leverage to ease blackout clauses in their contracts with PG&E. SMUD general manager Jan Schori is going to use every avenue ... any avenue to put pressure on including lobbying the ISO the governor and others said utility director Davis. The Northern California Power Agency a joint-powers authority that owns and operates power plants for municipal utilities has begun informal negotiations with PG&E to change blackout rules according to Fraser its top executive. It is preparing to write PG&E asking that its members be exempted from outages altogether. Failing that it wants them to face fewer outages or to be compensated for cutting off power he said. At SMUD the utility board has met in closed session to discuss exactly what it is required to do during electric emergencies under terms of the interconnection contract that links SMUD's lines to PG&E's. The contracts are being inspected with a fine-tooth comb said SMUD director Howard Posner. Schori declined to comment on any specifics. Sources indicated that the main option being considered is notifying PG&E that because of changed circumstances SMUD believes it no longer is required to routinely comply with outage requests. Other options being explored include re-negotiating existing agreements with PG&E. Posner said that ever since two days of rolling blackouts in January constituents have been asking him  'Why are we participating when we're not the problem?' And I don't have a good answer to that. Several directors said SMUD has already spent a lot of money -- and is considering 16 percent rate increases -- to ensure that it has enough electricity under contract to meet its customers' summer demands. They believe PG&E should do the same. We're almost like a David against Goliath here said board vice president Genevieve Shiroma. The huge investor-owned utilities next door have severe problems that they need to get under control. In addition SMUD plans to argue that because it can cut usage through its Peak Corps program which remotely turns off air conditioners at volunteer households it has already done its part without rotating outages director Davis said. PG&E believes the interconnection agreements that govern smaller utilities' ties to its transmission lines have benefits and burdens to both sides said Nelson. It wouldn't be fair or good policy for just one provision to be altered without taking a look at how that affects the entire contract he said. Interconnection contracts generally have clauses that require utilities to help each other out to avert greater emergencies. Sometimes reducing demand -- called load shedding -- can be the only way to stabilize the electric grid in the seconds after a major power plant or transmission line fails. It's been around in the electrical fabric forever said Jim Pope head of Silicon Valley Power Santa Clara's city-run utility. In addition to legal requirements you have a moral obligation so you don't bring the system to collapse. Like other city-run utilities Silicon Valley Power has a contract with PG&E that requires it to shed load during an electric emergency. But its contract allows it to work with big users to reduce their demand so no one has to be completely shut off. Such agreements formed long before deregulation when PG&E ran the north state's grid now are complicated by the 1997 creation of the state Independent System Operator. The ISO today runs pieces of the grid owned by PG&E Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric Co. If it believes power use is about to surge past supply potentially triggering a grid collapse across the western United States the ISO notifies the three utilities that they have to shed a certain number of megawatts. The big utilities meet that requirement two ways. They cut circuits to some of their own customers and they tell smaller connected utilities to cut a proportionate share. In Northern California about 80 percent of the outages are borne by PG&E customers and the rest by customers of SMUD and other municipal utilities and irrigation districts. In one sense we are all in this together. If SMUD were in danger of going down we would hope others would help us out said SMUD's Posner. But that's if we're in danger from circumstances beyond our control not from mismanagement or lack of financial wherewithal. It is unclear what penalties if any a utility would face for violating an interconnection agreement. In the long run the issue would be fought either in the courts or before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission grid officials said. As a practical matter in the seconds when the risk to the grid is greatest if one utility refused to shed load the ISO would probably solve to problem by calling on PG&E Edison or others who are willing to make deeper cutbacks they said. ---- PUC to Decide Fate Of Utility Workers PG&E Edison want to trim costs by laying off thousands cutting service Bernadette Tansey Chronicle Staff Writer Wednesday March 7 2001 2001 San Francisco Chronicle State regulators are set to decide today whether debt-ridden Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern California Edison can conserve cash by laying off thousands of workers and letting service standards slip. Union officials who protested the layoffs before the California Public Utilities Commission warn that if the cuts go through neighborhoods hit by power outages could stay dark for hours and more customers could face busy signals when they call about their bills. An administrative law judge agreed advising the commission in February to order the utilities to restore 725 positions already cut and block the elimination of an additional 2125 jobs. Judge John Wong said PG&E and Edison have acknowledged the layoffs will not substantially improve their shaky financial condition which arose from skyrocketing wholesale electricity costs the utilities could not pass on to consumers under a rate cap. The savings would barely make a dent Wong said in his draft decision. The two companies together claim that their debt from power purchases amounts to more than $13 billion. PG&E says it has saved $18 million from the first wave of 325 layoffs. Wong's recommendation is already running into resistance on the PUC. Commissioner Richard Bilas said the five-member panel should not be micromanaging the utilities in a time of crisis. Bilas has proposed an alternate ruling that would allow the utilities to make the cuts but provide for PUC monitoring of service in case the commission wants to step in later. We're in a situation where the utilities are not collecting the revenues they need to operate and yet we may be guilty of not letting them cut expenses where they can cut expenses Bilas said. PG&E spokesman Jon Tremayne said savings from the layoffs are helping to keep electricity running and gas flowing. It keeps cash in our accounts so we can keep doing day-to-day business Tremayne said. In addition to the 325 positions dropped so far PG&E is proposing to cut an additional 675 during the next three to six months. The cuts affect temporary and contract workers who read meters handle new service hookups and replace equipment. PG&E has no plans to eliminate permanent positions. The company is struggling to keep up with a higher workload at its call center as customers deluge the lines with inquiries about their rising bills and the effects of deregulation. Calls to PG&E ballooned from 1.3 million in January 2000 to 2.3 million in January 2001. Bilas advocates granting PG&E's request to temporarily relax standards requiring the utility to respond swiftly to customer calls and to read customers' meters once a month. PG&E wants to read meters bimonthly and send bills based on the estimated use between readings. Discrepancies could be corrected later. Wong called those measures unacceptable. He said customers need to know immediately if their efforts to conserve power are working. Wong also said the utilities' own experts have said the workforce reductions will lengthen the time required to restore power after nonemergency equipment failure. Eric Wolfe communications director for the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 1245 said some customers have already been left without power overnight because PG&E is trying to avoid the use of overtime on nonemergency power outages. It hurts a lineman to walk away from the job leaving a customer without power Wolfe said. Tremayne said PG&E is trying to minimize overtime costs but denied the company has allowed customers to go without power out of financial concerns. He said crews were pulled out when darkness and falling trees made the work too dangerous. ---- Power prices could soar during the summer Posted at 10:35 p.m. PST Tuesday March 6 2001 BY STEVE JOHNSON Mercury News Unless Gov. Gray Davis arranges significantly more long-term electricity contracts or persuades people to turn off a lot more lights California's unpredictable spot market for power could wreak havoc this summer. Even with the 40 long-term deals announced by Davis on Monday experts interviewed Tuesday said up to 43 percent of the state's daily needs may have to come from this highly volatile market in which power is bought within a day of need. That could could prove hugely expensive because some spot market energy has cost five to six times what it would under the long-term contracts. It's widely expected that consumers ultimately would have to pay that tab which could amount to billions of dollars. And because that power won't be locked up in contracts there is no guarantee it will be available when it's needed which could lead to blackouts according to a recent report to the California Independent System Operator which oversees three-fourths of the state's power grid. ``The situation in California could reach catastrophic proportions'' the report concluded adding that unless things change dramatically ``it is a virtual certainty that peak demand will go unmet during many hot summer days.'' Steven Maviglio Davis' press secretary conceded Tuesday that the spot market could be troublesome. ``It's a major concern'' he said which is why the state is trying to line up more power contracts speed up power plant construction and promote conservation. During the normally hot month of August peak daily demand for power in the Independent System Operator's territory is expected to hit about 47700 megawatts -- enough for nearly 48 million homes. The state's three main utility firms generate about 8200 megawatts and have long-term contracts from wind solar and other energy sources for about 11700 megawatts more. That totals about 20000 megawatts. Add in the 7000 megawatts of long-term power that Davis has announced for this summer and the state is still nearly 21000 megawatts short. Costly proposition If all that power has to be obtained on the spot market the price could be high. On Friday last-minute purchases on the market averaged $411 per megawatt-hour compared to about $150 per megawatt-hour for all power obtained by the Independent System Operator and $69 per megawatt-hour on average under Davis' long-term contracts. It's possible that not all 21000 megawatts would have to be purchased on the market. Assuming Davis is successful in getting people to save 10 percent -- which could prove difficult -- conservation could reduce peak demand by nearly 5000 megawatts. California also might be able to trade for another 5000 megawatts with the federal government's Bonneville Power Administration and a hydroelectric operator in British Columbia said Arthur O'Donnell editor of California Energy Markets a trade publication. Under such deals those two outfits often send that much power to California when they don't need it and California returns the same amount or more when its demand is low. But O'Donnell said it wasn't clear whether 5000 megawatts would be available this summer because ``they still haven't gotten the snowpack they need in the Pacific Northwest'' which could limit that region's generating capacity. Still falling short Even if those hydropower imports are available and conservation works as Davis hopes it's likely California would still require the spot market for 11000 megawatts to meet the August demand. That's more than 20 percent of the state's overall power needs. ``All of the surrounding states are buying probably less than 5 percent at most of their energy on the spot market'' said Frank Wolak a Stanford economist who monitors electricity prices for the Independent System Operator. He worries about how much that power could cost and is disturbed that state officials haven't adequately addressed the issue. ``No one has any idea what they are going to do and that is part of the problem'' he said. Officials at Pacific Gas & Electric Co. are particularly concerned. They fear that their company -- which is nearing bankruptcy -- could get stuck for much of the spot market purchases by the Independent System Operator which has threatened to bill the utilities for the cost. Fearing the annual bill for that power could hit $2.4 billion this year PG&E wants the tab sent to the Department of Water Resources which also is buying power on the spot market for the state. But the Department of Water Resources has objected to that idea and the matter is expected to be heard today by the California Public Utilities Commission. ``We're looking for clarity on a number of issues'' regarding how the spot market will work ``and certainly that's one of them'' said Thomas Hannigan the water agency's director. ``I don't think anybody knows the answer of who's going to pay for it'' added PG&E spokesman John Nelson. But Nettie Hoge executive director of the Utility Reform Network in San Francisco said she suspects consumers ultimately will foot the bill. The unfortunate likelihood about spot market purchases is that ``ratepayers are responsible for all of it eventually'' Hoge said. ``It's a very big problem.'' ---- Power Plant Plans Cause Conflicts East county residents blast supervisors Jason B. Johnson Chronicle Staff Writer Wednesday March 7 2001 Industry dreams of building new power plants in east Contra Costa's hills are prompting an angry reaction among residents and elected officials who say they don't want more plants. The conflict was sparked by a vote by county supervisors yesterday to aggressively explore possible sites for new power plants throughout the county. The measure by Supervisors Mark DeSaulnier and Federal Glover which passed on a 4-to-0 vote directs the county administrator and Department of Community Development to compile a report on possible sites within 45 days. Supervisor Donna Gerber abstained after criticizing the plan for potentially repeating the same mistakes that plagued the state's energy deregulation effort by not considering how much energy the state region and county will need in future years and how much power is slated to come online. Gerber said alternative power sources such as solar should also be examined. A site drawing much attention is on top of a deposit of natural gas near the Concord Naval Weapons Station off Highway 4. The owners of 70 acres of land near the station recently formed a company Golden State Power Co. to pursue construction of at least one small peaker plant and a much larger facility capable of producing 600 megawatts. The site could hold up to three small 50-megawatt peaker plants and a larger 15-acre natural gas plant said Steve Thomas managing partner with Golden State. No land use applications have been filed. Thomas said 30 acres could be kept as open space to form a buffer around the project. Both (facilities) are state of the art said Thomas. We believe that the site is ideal. But east county residents at yesterday's meeting blasted the supervisorial measure and the power plant proposal complaining that more plants could put people's health at risk. The region already is home to six power plants. We're going to get a good dose of poor air quality and (negative) health conditions from this said Concord resident Evelyn Frietas. I think we need to stop and think about what we're doing to our quality of life. Dan Torres said the home he bought in 1995 at a new Bay Point development would be alarmingly close to the proposed Golden State site. It will be dragging emissions over our home said Torres. I didn't buy a home on that hill to be surrounded by power plants. There are six power plants in operation in east Contra Costa. Pittsburg already has two power plants and two more under construction. City Council members Frank Aiello and Yvonne Beals said the Antioch-Pittsburg area has done more than its share of energy production. Aiello said Pittsburg will soon produce enough energy to power three million homes in California. When is enough enough? asked Aiello. Pittsburg has shouldered responsibility for a land-fill and two more power plants. At some point you have to say enough. Beals said that while power plants have added millions to the city's general fund the negatives of additional plants could outweigh the benefits. I don't think that Pittsburg or east county should be the dumping ground for energy for California said Beals. ---- Supervisors set search for power plant sites The board also heard from the potential developers of a 650-megawatt plant between Bay Point and Concord By Thomas Peele TIMES STAFF WRITER MARTINEZ -- Contra Costa County supervisors took tentative steps Tuesday toward allowing the construction of at least one small power plant before summer ordering that its staff identify potential sites in unincorporated areas within seven weeks. The board voted 4-0 to search for locations. Third District Supervisor Donna Gerber abstained saying her colleagues lacked a comprehensive context'' to identify sites. I think the board knows just enough to be dangerous'' she said. Gerber said the county should examine the potential for additional power plants within its borders but not investigate individual sites yet. But Fourth District Supervisor Mark DeSaulnier said the action was necessary because of the energy crisis and because of Gov. Gray Davis' call for local governments to help speed the construction of so-called peaker plants before July and August. I wouldn't do this except under an emergency DeSaulnier said after the vote. There are unusual circumstances. We're not talking about putting this in a residential area. Fifth District Supervisor Federal Glover backed DeSaulnier but said he hoped for a location outside his heavily industrialized East County district. There's a lot of concern in East County as to the number of plants he said. DeSaulnier said though that the only logical place for a small plant remains the industrial belt'' stretching along the waterfront from West County to Antioch. He declined to provide specifics but said the only other potential site outside the industrial areas was the Concord Naval Weapons Station property. But he quickly added that he believes the U.S. Department of Defense would never go for it. Also DeSaulnier said he could not rule out the county building the plant itself and entering the electricity-selling market during peak demand times. Board Chairwoman Gayle Uilkema called that idea extremely premature and unlikely. That's a very powerful decision. I do not think we are ready'' she said. The California Energy Commission listed the Equilon refinery in Martinez as one of 32 potential peaker plant sites in the state last week. Peaker plants kick in during peak usage times. Davis called for their quick construction before the height of summer and its energy demand for air conditioning. Plants that generate as much as 50000 megawatts don't need Energy Commission approval. DeSaulnier said he believed a peaker plant could be built about a month after final approval. Supervisors also heard from the potential developers of a 650-megawatt plant between Bay Point and Concord. Walnut Creek commercial real estate developer Steve Thomas announced his intentions for the site north of Highway 4 last week. Construction could take two years. Eric Hasseltine a consultant representing Thomas and what he described as a brand new company for the site the Golden State Power Co. told supervisors that if they intended to speed peaker plant construction they should do what they can to expedite the larger plant. The Thomas site could house a peaker plant until the proposed larger one goes online. A large natural gas line passes under the site. DeSaulnier seemed cautious about the larger proposal which he had described last week as a good site. Uilkema too said she knew too little about it to comment. A resident who lives near the Thomas property asked the board to build it (the larger plant) closer to where you have industrial areas. You have to carefully consider the people who live nearby said Dan Torres 39. Evelyn Freitas of Concord said she lives downwind of the proposed site. Our air quality is going to be worse then it is now she said. Gerber played on the environmental issues saying the county already ranks second statewide to Los Angeles in volume of hazardous materials and amount of electrical generation. ---- Peter Schrag: California's $90 billion infrastructure gap (Published March 7 2001) By now California's surreal energy mess has grown from a crisis to a condition. It may not be quite as permanent as say death and taxes but it's still something that could get a whole lot worse before it gets better. Until there's more realistic pricing no gubernatorial pea-under-the-shell buyout scheme will solve it. Beyond the energy crisis however and in many ways similar to it California faces a whole range of other infrastructure problems -- in transportation in water resources and sewer systems in school and university buildings -- that seem once again to be all but forgotten. The Business Roundtable has estimated the need at roughly $90 billion though no number can possibly be exact. What's certain is that after a burst of high-level investment in public facilities during the 1950s and 1960s California's annual capital investment has sunk precipitously -- from an annual $150 per capita in the 1960s according to a set of recent studies for PPIC the Public Policy Institute of California to about $30 in the 1990s. But you probably don't need to tell anyone driving Bay Area or Los Angeles freeways or looking at the ubiquitous portable classrooms those dreary brown boxes that house a fourth of our public school students. Ever since passage of Proposition 13 in 1978 we have been flying the flag of deferred maintenance. As in the state's electricity crisis however there's no way California can effectively address those problems merely by building or bonding itself out of them. In highway construction in developing water resources in finding enough university space to accommodate the Tidal Wave II of students managing demand is likely to be as crucial to any solution as new construction. In the energy market -- and in electricity particularly -- it's been a familiar principle ever since David Roe of the Environmental Defense Fund first persuaded Pacific Gas and Electric that a dollar invested in conservation may be worth as much as the same investment in new generation. But in most other sectors of California's infrastructure state and local it's a lesson still to be learned. There have been scattered attempts to encourage conservation and reduce demand -- significant reduction in water use for example through the installation of low-flow faucets and low-flush toilets some reduction in traffic by using rush-hour diamond lanes or by adjusting highway or (as in New York) bridge tolls to levels of congestion. But as pointed out by David Dowall an urban economist at Berkeley state policy-makers have not really begun to consider how demand management strategies can be applied to infrastructure service areas or how the more efficient use of facilities and more realistic pricing -- highway tolls say or parking fees -- can reduce demand for scarce infrastructure resources. In any case says Dowall in one of the PPIC reports we should pick which major projects we will build not just according to per capita estimates of how much we need but according to how much consumers are willing to pay for them. To avoid hurting the poor congestion-related highway tolls and other tariffs can be rebated on the basis of income. University fees can be means-tested. In California they also could be adjusted to encourage summer school classes and other off-peak uses rather than (as in the past) making UC summer courses more expensive. Given the political and economic uncertainties there's no way to know how far such demand management can be taken. But there's not much doubt that as Dowall and others point out the state's infrastructure planning is a jumble of uncoordinated agency agendas and wish lists. The Legislature last year passed a bill AB 1473 by Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg that requires the governor beginning next year to submit an annual five-year infrastructure plan for state agencies and public schools along with recommendations on how to fund it. In addition Gov. Gray Davis' infrastructure commission is expected to recommend better coordination of infrastructure and land-use planning when it issues its report this spring. That would be a start. As California State Treasurer Phil Angelides has pointed out the state desperately needs to start joint planning -- regional planning -- for housing roads and other resources to reduce the need for long commutes to preserve open space and to bring jobs to where people live and housing to where the jobs are. That would itself reduce demand for more freeway lanes and equally important improve the quality of life. At present most planning for housing roads water systems and other facilities rarely recognizes the regional impact of local decisions. In the East Bay slow-growth forces push well-intended initiatives that would force more development into Tracy or Modesto and further tax the transportation systems to Silicon Valley. In city after city there are beggar-thy-neighbor efforts to grab yet another shopping mall that produces a little extra sales tax revenue for the city that gets it and that often compounds traffic and revenue problems in adjacent communities. In higher education we divide bond proceeds evenly among UC the California State University and the community colleges even though the community colleges serve eight times as many students as UC. We plan road projects according to county not regional priorities. It is all done according to antiquated political and fiscal formulas that often no longer make sense. We don't just need better capital planning we need a whole new planning system. ---- PG&E power plan debated at hearing A PUC meeting on the utility's capacity expansion project for the Tri-Valley follows weeks of protest from officials residents Power upgrade in valley debated By Megan Long TIMES STAFF WRITER SAN FRANCISCO -- Dublin officials and the developer of a Livermore subdivision faced questions Tuesday about their opposition to alternative routes of PG&E's controversial Tri-Valley power upgrade plan -- and answered by restating their long-standing objections. Tuesday's cross-examination came during the third and likely final week of the California Public Utility Commission's evidentiary hearings on the utility's $91 million Tri-Valley 2002 Capacity Increase Project. It has followed weeks of protests of PG&E's upgrade plans by officials and residents of Livermore Pleasanton Dublin and San Ramon. And before the questioning started Dublin Vice Mayor Janet Lockhart reiterated concerns about an alternative route deemed environmentally superior that would place a substation just 1000 feet north of Interstate 580 between Tassajara and Fallon roads. She said that would undermine the results of a 15-year process to plan the eastern development of the city. It's extremely important to the residents of our community to follow a plan we worked hard to produce she said. Dublin officials favor PG&E's proposed placement of the station three miles north of the freeway away from new high-tech company offices and housing developments. Besides the Dublin substation the project calls for construction of a substation in North Livermore expansion of the Pleasanton substation and installation of 23.5 miles of new lines. In response to questions from PUC Administrative Law Judge Michelle Cooke Dublin's public works director Lee Thompson confirmed that the Lin family the owner of the property where the alternative substation would go wasn't interested in selling the land to PG&E. Cooke also asked Thompson to define a discretionary permit which is how city officials said they might treat a permit for a substation. Lee said that type of permit is one the city has the right to approve or not depending on the project's impact. Eddie Peabody Dublin's community development director testified that the zoning for the Lin property accommodates uses such as commercial business research and development and light manufacturing. It would not he said be appropriate for a power substation. He said parcels within the East Dublin area that could host a station would include those zoned for public and semi-public uses including land recently bought by Oracle and Sun Microsystems for new campuses. While Dublin officials testified that one buyer of land in that area paid $86 per square foot others suggested land prices would be inflated to help make a PG&E land buy look prohibitively expensive. An executive of Centex Homes the developer of new houses near Isabel Avenue and Concannon Boulevard objected to an alternative route that would place high-voltage transmission lines overhead along Isabel and Stanley Boulevard. David Barclay president of Centex's Northern California division said that the 80-foot to 150-foot towers would have a severe visual impact on residents of the Prima tract. Ed O'Neill a lawyer for the Kottinger Ranch Homeowners Association pointed out that existing distribution lines on 50-foot poles on Isabel already mar the view for residents. The Foley family has been ranching on land south of Pleasanton city limits for years said their attorney Kennedy Richardson. The utility's project would place overhead lines and a transmission station on rolling hills that the family envisions as one day being public open space with limited development Richardson said. Lawyers for Pleasanton Livermore Kottinger Ranch and Centex are scheduled to cross-examine a PG&E engineer today about the project's routing. That testimony should be the most controversial of the hearings. Judge Cooke is expected to recommend an alignment by July to the PUC which will make the final decision. ---- NEWS State OKs 'Peaker' Power Plant at SFO / Temporary generator could be sending electricity to 50000 homes by August Marshall Wilson 03/08/2001 The San Francisco Chronicle FINAL Page A.20 (Copyright 2001) State energy officials yesterday approved plans to build a temporary electrical plant at San Francisco International Airport that should generate enough juice to power 50000 homes by August. Meeting in Sacramento the Energy Commission voted 4-0 to give the green light to the gas-fired plant. It will operate during peak summer and winter demand to help the state avoid Stage 3 power alerts and rolling blackouts. Texas-based El Paso Merchant Energy Co. won approval under a new state law mandating speedy four-month reviews of so-called peaker plants. It was the only one of seven applications statewide to win approval. The other proposals were withdrawn for various reasons. The 51-megawatt plant formally called the United Golden Gate Power Project is scheduled to be built at the northwest corner of the airport near the United Airlines maintenance center. Within the next few weeks El Paso plans to apply to build a 571- megawatt $400 million plant in the same area company spokesman Jesse Frederick said. It would undergo a separate review by state energy officials. The small peaker plant approved yesterday is to generate electricity beginning around Aug. 1 for up to three years. After the end of three years the plant would be closed or converted to a cleaner-burning system. Under state law a temporary peaker plant is permitted to spew more air pollution than a permanent plant. El Paso's temporary plant is to be built next to a co-generation plant operated by United Airlines. It would use existing connections for natural gas and water supplies and tap into existing power transmission lines. Electricity generated by the plant would be pumped into the state's electrical grid Energy Commission spokesman Gary Fay said. It would also serve as a backup for San Francisco Airport in case of a blackout. No one spoke against the proposed plant at yesterday's commission meeting. The proposal however has been criticized by area residents and environmentalists worried about air pollution. Scott Buschman a professional photographer and San Bruno resident said yesterday it was unjust that state officials 100 miles away in Sacramento approved a Texas company's proposal to put a power plant on land owned by San Francisco. The fact that they approved it without considering the public's concerns foremost air quality is very disturbing he said. Fay said the plant complies with clean-air standards. Answering the criticism about the location of yesterday's deliberation he said three hearings and several workshops were held in communities near the airport. Copyright  2000 Dow Jones & Company Inc. All Rights Reserved. ---- Crossed Wires: Major Kinks Emerge In Gov. Davis's Plan To Power California --- State's Outlays for Electricity May Be Hard to Recover Without Rate Increases --- Betting on Long-Term Deals By Wall Street Journal staff reporters Rebecca Smith Mitchel Benson and John R. Emshwiller 03/08/2001 The Wall Street Journal A1 (Copyright (c) 2001 Dow Jones & Company Inc.) SACRAMENTO Calif. -- Earlier this year Gov. Gray Davis made what may be the biggest bet in the history of the nation's biggest state: that he could tame an out-of-control electricity market and avoid devastating blackouts without busting the state's budget antagonizing its consumers or derailing his own political career. His wager is still on the table but the assumptions that underlie it are looking increasingly shaky these days. The governor has already spent around $2 billion of public money buying hugely expensive wholesale power taking over the role formerly played by the state's near-bankrupt electric utilities. And California will probably be obliged to spend billions more before its electricity market stabilizes and those utilities are restored to some semblance of financial health. Under the governor's plan California aims to recoup the money it is using to buy electricity by issuing $10 billion in bonds. That way it would still have a healthy budget surplus to finance new spending on roads schools and other public services. But there's a potentially big obstacle to this plan. The state Legislature worried about racking up billions in new debt has put limits on the size of any bond offering. In broad terms the Legislature's action would allow the state to borrow only four times as much as it can recover annually from utility customers. Right now that doesn't appear to be much. Under the current rate structure essentially set in place by California's flawed 1996 electricity-deregulation plan consumers pay far less for power than the cost of acquiring it on the wholesale market. Preliminary estimates submitted by utilities last month to the California Public Utilities Commission show the state's share of the proceeds from electricity sales this year could be as little as $241 million -- not enough to support even $1 billion in bond sales under the Legislature's formula. That would leave the state on the hook for much of the money it has already paid for power -- not to mention the billions more Gov. Davis will need to spend. That in turn raises the prospect that California's economy and its credit rating both could deteriorate significantly. But state finance officials say that based on their own projections they will be able to extract enough money to support a $10 billion bond issue. Walking a careful line between fiscal prudence and political survival Mr. Davis and others in his administration are scrambling to come up with ways to get around the legislative restrictions without raising rates for consumers. If I wanted to raise rates I could solve this problem in 20 minutes Mr. Davis says. The governor says he believes that the state can obtain enough affordable power through long-term power-supply contracts to avoid the need for a big rate increase. The billions of dollars the state hopes to borrow would be used to help pay for power until electricity prices drop as they are expected to do when new power plants come online over the next few years. The Davis administration fears that what may be its only other option -- a big increase in retail electric rates -- could prompt angry consumer groups to seek new electricity laws through a statewide ballot initiative during next year's election. That's when Mr. Davis is expected to run for a second term as governor. But trying to save California without rate increases is forcing Mr. Davis to make some colossal gambles with the state's money. State officials estimate that in the next several months California will need to spend as much as $6 billion on power purchases -- equivalent to the state's entire fiscal surplus. Mr. Davis is also looking to spend several billion more to buy the transmission assets of three investor-owned utilities in order to restore two of them to credit-worthiness. He also has announced plans to spend several hundred million dollars more on conservation programs designed to reduce demand while new power plants are being built in the state. In order to limit the state's financial exposure in the meantime the governor and his aides have in some cases ignored state law. They have threatened appointed officials who have stood in the way. And they have sharply restricted the flow of information to the public. None of those steps is expected to do much to reduce state spending on power in the coming months. In a few weeks power usage is expected to begin a sharp seasonal rise as Californians switch on their air conditioners with the coming of warmer weather. By various estimates demand during peak periods this summer could outstrip supply by 10% or several thousand megawatts. That could produce more rolling blackouts like the ones that hit Northern California earlier this year. It is also likely to put strong upward pressure on wholesale electricity prices. Steven Zimmerman managing director of Standard & Poor's Corp. says Mr. Davis and his aides don't have a lot of time to put a cap on the state's financial exposure to the crisis. The credit-rating agency has put the state on credit watch for a possible downgrade which would affect the value of all of California's outstanding public debt. Moody's Investor Service Inc. is also concerned. It said in a recent report that the power crisis could soon seriously threaten the health of the state's economy. Mr. Davis a Democrat and career politician was dealt a bad hand when he took office in 1999. The deregulation plan that sparked the state's electricity crisis was enacted under his predecessor Republican Pete Wilson. But Mr. Davis was slow to react to early signs of trouble this past summer and alarms sounded by members of the state Legislature. By the time Mr. Davis finally sprang into action earlier this year a troublesome power-supply squeeze had escalated into a crisis. In a Jan. 17 declaration of emergency the governor designated the state Department of Water Resources to take the utilities' place as the daily buyer of huge quantities of electricity. His hope: that by making the state the dominant player in California's power sector he would ease electricity producers' concerns about getting paid and give the state enough clout to negotiate lower long-term power prices. Earlier this week Mr. Davis announced final or tentative agreements with 20 power suppliers to furnish the state with a total of 8900 megawatts for periods of as long as 20 years. But the supply situation remains extremely uncertain for this summer when demand probably will top 45000 megawatts. If the state can secure enough power under contract and push down demand through aggressive conservation it might be able to squeak through the summer season. If not it will be forced to keep buying huge amounts of costly power in the cash market. Under deregulation retail electric rates were frozen for several years while wholesale-power costs were free to fluctuate. When the plan was conceived wholesale prices were low and expected to go lower. However a combination of unexpected growth in power demand and a lack of new generating capacity helped produce a supply squeeze. Average wholesale prices more than tripled last year from 1999. And in January those prices were up 10-fold from a year earlier. By then California's two biggest investor-owned utilities -- the Pacific Gas & Electric unit of PG&E Corp. and the Southern California Edison subsidiary of Edison International -- faced imminent financial collapse. They had racked up billions of dollars in wholesale power bills they couldn't afford to pay. As generators began shying away from selling to the two utilities the Clinton administration forced them to sell power into the California market an order left in place during the first weeks of the Bush administration. Still northern California was hit by rolling blackouts on several days in early January. Since then the DWR which does some electricity trading as an adjunct to its main mission of managing the state's giant system of aqueducts and reservoirs has had to learn the ins and outs of power markets on the run. It hasn't been easy. David Mills trading-floor manager for the federal Bonneville Power Administration says the water agency has at times offered to pay $50 to $100 per megawatt hour more than the available market price. They agree to prices that make you wonder says Mr. Mills whose organization markets electricity from federal dams in the Pacific Northwest. You'd at least think they'd check to see what the prevailing price is before throwing out their offer. Mr. Mills says that to cut California some slack he occasionally has instructed his traders to sell at prices lower than the DWR had offered to pay. Ray Hart the water agency deputy director responsible for the power purchasing says he isn't aware of any cases in which the DWR has overpaid. He says his team has been extremely successful by all measures. Ultimately the DWR's trading acumen is far less important than the overall arithmetic of power supply and demand in California. With the price of natural gas that feeds many of the region's generating plants at near record levels and some suppliers reluctant to sell into the troubled California market wholesale electric prices remain stubbornly high and in recent days have again been rising. The Legislature has advanced the DWR about $3 billion from the state's general fund for power purchases. Under emergency legislation passed by the Legislature and signed by Mr. Davis on Feb. 1 the general fund is to be reimbursed from a planned bond sale later this year. But under terms of the emergency law the water agency would have to wrest $2.5 billion a year in revenue from retail electricity rates in order to sell the $10 billion worth of bonds sought by Mr. Davis. Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg a Southern California Democrat says the formula was created to ensure that there would be a way to repay the bonds without draining the state's coffers. We didn't want to just open our wallets he says. According to the language of the Feb. 1 law the water agency gets what's left of revenue collected from ratepayers after the utilities pay certain of their own power-supply bills and other expenses. And in their filings with the PUC last month the utilities reckoned under their worst-case scenarios that there would be only $241 million available to the DWR this year. State officials are quietly pushing the PUC to rejigger the formula so that the water department gets more money -- even though that would clash with terms of the Feb. 1 law. Robert Miyashiro deputy director of the Department of Finance says the emergency law was drafted poorly and has led people to believe the DWR only gets the leftover money. He predicts there will be cleanup legislation. At the request of the Davis administration the PUC is considering a plan to use a different revenue-sharing formula than the one in the state law. The proposed new formula was written in close consultation with Mr. Davis's Finance Department says PUC President Loretta Lynch who supports the initiative and is hoping to rush it through. The effort has drawn some opposition. Commissioner Richard Bilas at a recent PUC meeting questioned the legality of the commission attempting to change a formula set by the Legislature. PG&E is even more emphatic since the DWR's extra money could come at the utility's expense. The formula threatens to undo the very financial protections for the utilities that [the new law] attempted to provide the utility said in a recent filing with the PUC. As politicians and regulators wrestle with that issue the Davis administration has taken a step to reduce the outflow of state cash that also seems to conflict with the Feb. 1 law. It was widely assumed that the law required the DWR to buy any electricity the state needed to keep its lights on. However on many occasions the DWR has refused to buy power on the grounds that it was too expensive citing a portion of the new law that urges the agency to hold down costs. The task of covering any remaining shortfall has passed to the California Independent System Operator which manages the state's energy grid and is charged with buying power when necessary to avert shortages. However the ISO doesn't have any power-purchasing money of its own and the major parties it would normally bill are PG&E and Edison whose inability to pay their power bills was the reason the state started buying electricity in the first place. Amid criticism of its stance from generators utilities and Wall Street the DWR says it has started covering more of the utilities' electricity costs. The water agency is now buying 95% to 99% of what California needs in a given day says the agency's Mr. Hart. But increased buying only adds to the uncertainty about the eventual tab. The state's legislative analyst Elizabeth Hill recently recommended that lawmakers hold off considering more than $2 billion in state spending on items ranging from college construction to beach cleanups because of continuing questions about the financial impact of the electricity crisis. Like others Ms. Hill complains that the governor's office and state agencies haven't been forthcoming with information. Indeed the DWR refuses to say precisely how much power it is purchasing and at what prices though it has on several occasions gone back to the Legislature for more money. State officials say that data on its purchasing activities would give suppliers an advantage in continuing electricity-supply contract talks. State Controller Kathleen Connell who is running for mayor of Los Angeles in an April election recently announced plans to post state power-spending information on her department's Web site. But within 24 hours Ms. Connell suspended that plan after discussions with senior Davis administration officials. I feel very strongly that this information should be publicly released says Ms. Connell. I just don't want to do anything that would weaken the state's effectiveness in negotiating. In an effort to more tightly control events the governor obtained legislative approval to abolish the 26-member ISO board which was made up of everyone from utility executives to representatives of consumer groups. He then appointed a new five-member board. To ensure a quick transition the California attorney general threatened the old board members with fines of as much as $5000 each if they didn't immediately relinquish their positions. All did. I was offended at the heavy-handed treatment says Karen Johanson a former ISO board member. One of the first acts of the ISO's new board was to close a meeting about the electricity crisis. The former ISO board routinely held such meetings in public. ISO attorneys say the meeting was largely designed as a private briefing for new board members and that the organization is committed to keeping its deliberations as open as possible. The Wall Street Journal and other news organizations have unsuccessfully challenged the closure in Sacramento state court. Copyright  2000 Dow Jones & Company Inc.

Kevin Los Angeles Daily News Friday June 22 2001 'Tonight Show' pokes fun at power crisis By Fred Shuster Staff Writer BURBANK -- Jay Leno pulled the plug on his late-night chat show Thursday doing his part for the state's energy crisis but viewers weren't left in the dark. Flashlights mining helmets and multicolor glow sticks helped to illuminate the set for the show dubbed a one-time-only The Tonight Show Unplugged which Leno said saved enough electricity to light a house for a month. [IMAGE] The unplugged edition of The Tonight Show with Jay Leno pokes fun at the California power crisis(Reed Saxon / A.P.) Call it NBC's Can't See TV. This is not some cheap rating ploy. ... If this works they're gonna make us do this every night Leno joked as part of his opening monologue. The nationally broadcast show featuring a comic interlude with California Gov. Gray Davis utilized just a small amount of electricity to run the cameras Leno said before the show began. Actually in Burbank where the taping took place at NBC Studios the city owns the power company and residents and businesses have not been hit by rolling blackouts as in other areas. The city made $5 million in profit in May after racking up $60 million in excess power sales. But Leno said not using studio lights TV monitors amplifiers and other power sources Thursday saved enough electricity to light a four-bedroom house for a month. Members of the house band wore miner's helmets with group leader Kevin Eubanks strumming an acoustic guitar rather than his regular electric instrument. The stage was lit by candles torches and flashlight beams trained on Leno. Members of the studio audience used the gear to help brighten the set. This is real goofy Leno said before taping got under way. We'll see what happens. Guests included Arsenio Hall Gilbert Gottfried a trainer of nocturnal animals and a Hawaiian fire dancer -- and a brief visit from the governor. Exuding whatever is the direct opposite of charisma Davis had a brief exchange with Leno drawing laughs with the line This is the first time Gray Davis and (the word) electricity have ever appeared in the same sentence. Leno's staff wore glasses with small lights attached and audience prompter Bob Perlow held a hand-scrawled applause sign aloft throughout the show instead of switching on the usual electric model. While there was little energy in play there was no shortage of laughs. Leno joked that President George W. Bush told Davis not to worry because I've been operating in the dark for years. Those in the studio said Leno's nocturnal transmission added excitement to the program. It was cool said Lillie Harrell 17 a tourist from Hammond La. The crowd got really involved. I guess it shows you don't really need all those lights. Added Jose Tano 21 a Burbank resident and student at the University of California Los Angeles It was a good idea and a great way to make a point. The local power company might not have made out very well but the studio audience didn't end up empty-handed. Each received a fluorescent lantern and pack of batteries as they left the studio.
