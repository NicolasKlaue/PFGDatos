    Hey Steve, I've got an update for you regarding AGA. It seems they've been a bit miffed about Enron not renewing our membership dues. Apparently, they've been trying to reach out to us through various channels, but haven't had much success. They've even mentioned that Bob Catell from Brooklyn Union might be giving Lay a call. I think we might want to consider pro-rating the dues"

    Enron will continue to focus its attention on the commercial light manufacturing and industrial end user markets. We are currently exploring opportunities to serve the residential market through a separate entity outside of Enron. The market presents opportunities that were not available even a couple of years ago, such as the rising acceptance of online purchasing by consumers, which presents low cost customer acquisition and account management possibilities.
